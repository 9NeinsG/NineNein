                        <h5>Open Source</h5></hgroup>
                    <p>Open Source is generally free and the code is public; meaning you will usually have full access to the program's code. This has many advantages and many flaws if you are not a developer or understand the language the program is written in to tweak, fix bugs, or create new features &amp; updates.</p>
                    <p>Although, the pro is even if you cant develop it further than the original - then it is just another program that is free and usable at your discretion 99% of the time.</p>
                    <hgroup class="bible-content tc">
                        <h5>Licensing:</h5>
                        <h5>Proprietary</h5></hgroup>
                    <p>Proprietary Software (not Open Source), such as Windows/Apple and other big name brand Softwares/Services/Products are not free and brings in the laws of pirating, terms/conditions, and legalities of using a software.</p>
                    <p>Licensing goes further than just downloading, installing, and using a software/product but it can/does extend to "content" created with the software/product in some cases - it is crucial one reads the terms and services.</p>
                    <p>Just because you bought/purchased the software does not mean you own it(you normally don't) or even guarantees to grant you the creative rights or royalties to anything you create with it in some instances.</p>

                    <p>When explaining Perpetual/Leasing and Subscription </p>
                    <hgroup class="bible-content tc">
                        <h5>Perpetual</h5></hgroup>
                    <p>Let me start off by stating clearly I do not lease software nor do I purchase subscriptions aka Cloud garbage;</p>
                    <p class="tc">unless they fall into specific niches(services), such as: Email, VPN, Hosting, Domains and the like.</p>
                    <p>I will only spend money on general software that I find myself rationalizing the reasons as to why I need a specific tool or program, at a specific cost/ratio of longevity.</p>
                    <p>I hope this sort of sums up a Perpetual License by example.</p>
                    <hgroup class="bible-content tc">
                        <h5>Leasing</h5></hgroup>
                    <p>Leasing is normally just a Perpetual License. Yet, NOT ALWAYS the case. In many cases it means exactly that (Leasing) and no different than a Subscription(Renting). This marketing term(Hype) is just that, is normally offered when you purchase a Perpetual License in which grants access to future updates(read the terms of software). Normally these updates are time sensitive(introductory) such as 6 months/1 year hence a Lease; again read the terms of the software.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, when the Lease expires you still have the Perpetual License with no more updates making it sort of a rent to own concept.</p>
                    <p>However, if it was Subscription your software expires the moment your(Lease/Subscription) ends.</p>
                    <hgroup class="bible-content tc">
                        <h5>Subscription</h5></hgroup>
                    <p>This is 100% time sensitive. This is the absolute worst way possible for software and only creates a Perpetual Pay Cycle that will dictate when and how you use the software. If they say update your Software you update, if they say buy this then you buy it, if they say prices changed you pay it, if they say you have been revoked you been revoked - absolute opposite of a Perpetual License.</p>
                    <p>This is a catch 22. Many mistake when I speak in these terms I am against supporting a Dev Team. This is not true, I understand Development, Changes, Updates, Features, etc. I also understand incompetence, lazy, corporatism, and milking.</p>
                    <p>Subscription should only be for services no different than your utilities and Never Foundational Software.</p>
                    <p>See "Legacy Section" of why this is so important.</p>

                            <h5>Cost</h5></hgroup>
                        <p>I hold the opinion that, if you use a software as a main tool, then you should support that company/team/software/project. However, if that software/company/team demands anything unreasonable of its user-base that team/software/company should be dropped and an alternative used instead.</p>
                        <p>Perpetual Licensing is fantastic for well built software, longevity, and solid computer life for it also allows one to ignore any demands that the software/company/team demands. Every Core Software should be Perpetually Licensed which is an investment of works of art themselves that are beneficial to your talent/craft/usage.</p>
                        <p>At what cost depends on you - just remember "you get what you pay for", your investment is only as good as "what you agreed to".</p></section>

                                                <p>When I say "pirating" is justified, it is.</p>
                                                <p> Notice how old this software is now. Yet, there have been no real advances in technology across the spectrum.</p>
                                                <p>Wherever there is open source, good business practice, and dedicated developers - you should always support them where you can.</p>

                                                    <h5>Addons/Plugins</h5></header>
                                                <p>With that said, many of the (Addons/Plugins) become the new hurdle; such as Waves(13) which for now - if I am not mistaken, still supports previous versions (9-12) with a perpetual license.</p>
                                                <p>So pirating is not quite as justified- yet. Eventually the only way to use these products will be by having to pirate- just so they run. Which, by that time is not really pirating, it is just archiving.</p>

                                                    <h5>Support Developers</h5></header>
                                                <p>Supporting the alternatives shows a demand and a market that wants nothing to do with their subscription Microsoft corporate congress. Don't expect the corporate to care. Actual developers will step in- sort of like where the alternatives already have: understanding that marketshare.</p>

                                                <p>Keep in mind this example applies across the entire tech spectrum; not just music software. This is just the most blatant; as with Adobe and nearly everything Microsoft, associates of Microsoft, etc. </p>
                                                <p>I am not against pirates as they are invaluable and are not even pirates anymore but simply archive enthusiasts, as far I am concerned.</p></div></div></div>

                            <p class="tc">This is where we must take a step back and look at the elephant in the room. Protools 11 was released in 2013 and Adobe CS6 was released 2012.</p>
                            <p class="tc">So what has changed with these programs since then?</p>
                            <p class="tc">Considering it has been a decade- nothing! A theme we will see repeated - even when we get into hardware.</p>
                            <p class="tc">Tech was on life support in 2012 and flatlined 2015 using 2012 tech.</p>
                            <P class="tc bh">Words are just words so heres a quick example.<br> 
                                Let's use Waves again for instance...<br> When you look at any software developments we will see a pattern.</P>
                            <p class="tc">Version 9 (2012):<wbr> Last massive update creating 64bit/AXX</p>
                            <p>Version 10:<wbr> A reskin for 25year anniversry(A Theme)<br>
                            Version 11:<wbr> to be compatible with Win 8 (Installer). Added 2 new plugins(1 was for Live Streaming the other Podcast).<br>
                            Version 12:<wbr> to be compatible with Win 10 (Installer). Added Plugin Resize(neat) and other GUI reskin glitter(another Theme), and useless gimmik plugins (garbage).</p>
                            <p class="tc">Version 13 (2022):<wbr> to be compatible with Win 11 and Apple (Installers)(nothing).</p>
                            <p class="tc">Since V9 nothing has changed! Except Microsoft and now Apple compatibility.</p>
                            <p>You can make the argument that some bugs were fixed(great), other things work a little better(so now works has was suppose to), looks sleeker(ok)... and all that may be true. However, is it worth the 10k($10,000) dollar price tag, specially when looking at the 10 year version milestones? I don't think so.</p>
                            <p>Now factor in <strong>EVERY</strong> single software. This is just 1 plugin company of 1 Software not included in the price. This is not an attack on Waves or any Software team. Waves make fantastic products. This is much more cancerous to the corporate level all in the name of "innovation" when there is 0 innovation at all.</p>
                            <p>The only difference between the Plugin from the 90s and the one you get in 2024 is none, zero, nada, non existent... other than one requires your reoccurring use of a credit card monthly for a plugin that at release to own is now how much you pay monthly just to use it. If you don't pay then no 90s tech for you. Im sorry I meant 2012 tech.</p></section>

                                            <p>The same thing on the Avid(ProTools) side with Protools11 and the newest version (pp: Payment Plan)</p>
                                            <p>Explained in great detail in Legacy and the importance of Legacy and Perpetual Licensing.</p>
                                            <p>In short Perpetual Licensing has kept me from having to deal with this nightmare.</p>
                                            <p>Instead of paying "20 a month or 200 a Year" for "just PhotoShop" and another "30-100 a month or WTF a year" for Protools - I have all the perks of Adobe &amp; Protools with no Payment Plan and without the forced updates - and without granting corporate access to my devices in order to use their products - nor can they revoke me to a large degree.</p>
                                            <p>Very Important when considering the Ratio/Cost.</p>
                                            <p>Keep in mind that these products are bundled with a ton of things you will never need or want. This turns solid software into Bloat-ware and, in most cases, you pay for that bloat.</p>
                                            <p>Not all updates are good - most updates are TRASH. Subscriptions make you dependent. Leasing software has you completely at the mercy of corporations.</p>
                                            <p>This is why there is an entire section dedicated to Legacy, Why and How.</p>
                                            <hgroup class="bible-content">
                                                <h5>Do not be a slave.</h5></hgroup>
                                            <p>I encourage you all to support developments. I must point out that there is a difference between supporting and being extorted.</p>
                                            <p>Be mindful of this as you review your budget and begin making choices of how you want to license the product. It is entirely up to you- UNLESS Adobe, Microsoft, Avid, etc. say otherwise.</p>
                                            <p>It does seem expensive for Perpetual Licenses when I say it cost anywhere between $50-$600! It is more expensive when you realize most are not even Available anymore.</p>
                                            <p>This realization snowballs when currently, the majority of subscriptions start at $120/year(Basic: $10/month) and can be as much as $953/year(Pro: $80/month)! Not including whatever is classified Add-ons and equipment.</p>
                                            <p>Which one is cheaper?
                                                <br> Cost/Ratio = Perpetual Licensing every-time.</p>
                                            <hgroup class="bible-content">
                                                <h5>Reality.</h5></hgroup>
                                            <p>If I did not have a perpetual license before Adobe switched to "Cloud Subscription" 10 years ago - well, you would have to multiply that grand total by $120 for the basic packages(1/4 of what I currently own : today would be $600 a year) x 10. Would be the price I had paid and with a payment due again next month.</p>
                                            <p>Having a Perpetual License(I paid $600 for) ends up being much cheaper than $6000 with a Payment due next month - if I did not have the Perpetual License, and it also means I own the software. Adobe can take that cloud nonsense elsewhere!</p>
                                            <p>*Loads up PhotoShop CS6*</p>
                                            <p>This is important to know so that you understand my recommendations, logic, and software choices. It is just beneficial to keep this in mind as we progress. See Legacy for much more details.</p>

                                        <p>Win 10= Subscription Based
                                            <br> Let's say you want to make music (enter any product).
                                            <br>
                                            <br> (Main Software) Protools= 40 a month.
                                            <br> (Instruments) NI= 10 a month
                                            <br> (Digital Gear) Waves= lets go super cheap= 8 a month</p>
                                        <p>That is $58 a month just for the basic software! What do you get other than a monthly bill? Nothing!</p>
                                        <p>Compare that to Waves which still does offer perpetual license ($99). Keep in mind the OS Limitation. For that $8 subscription.</p>
                                        <p>Or Native Instruments which still does offer perpetual license (Free-$99). Keep in mind the OS Limitation. For that $10 subscription.</p>
                                        <p>In the not so long ago we would call this a payment plan- only problem here is once you make the final payment you receive nothing but your next payment due statement.</p>
                                        <p>When you look at software developments we will see a pattern. Let's use Waves again for instance...
                                            <br>
                                            <br> Since Version 9 (2012): Last massive update creating 64bit/AXX
                                            <br> Version 10: A reskin for 25year anniversry(A Theme)
                                            <br> Version 11: to be compatible with Win 8 (Installer). Added 2 new plugins(1 was for Live Streaming the other Podcast).
                                            <br> Version 12: to be compatible with Win 10 (Installer). Added Plugin Resize(neat) and other GUI reskin glitter(another Theme), and useless gimmik plugins (garbage).
                                            <br> Version 13 (2022): to be compatible with Win 11 and Apple (Installers)(nothing).</p>
                                        <p>Since V9 nothing has changed! Except Microsoft compatibility. Yet, with a subscription these nearly nonexistant change/updates you will be charged for.</p>
                                        <p>There is no reason to actully innovate when you have a constant forced subscription stream of money and Microsoft Corporate funding.</p>
                                        <p>This demonstrates what you get for that $969 a year Basic Subscription to make music - yes $969 a year. </p>
                                        <p>3 forced OS updates, fancier gui, and apple= $2907 (OS Retail Version Based) worth of Subscription on Basic Package.</p>
                                        <p>The next slap in the face is V9 was released 2012... it is 2023! Thats 11 years!</p>
                                        <p>That means if you started at the transition you paid... wait for it... $9,690 for those $99 basic packages.</p>
                                        <p>Just to really drive this point home, you could have bought and OWNED the entire Waves Library Bundle of all 180 Plugins, all of Fab Filter, everything NI offers, and any DAW of your choice with all the bells and whistles with hardware (comps,eqs,mixboard,mics,keyboard), instruments- you know an ACTUAL little REAL life recording music studio.</p>
                                        <p>And still had $1200 in your pocket and 0 payments.</p>
                                        <p>Instead, you get to choose between paying $10 forever for $99 product or $20 forever for a $199 product for each product.</p>
                                        <p>You really will own nothing, make your monthly payment forever, and only ever receive the same $99-$199 product.</p>
                                        <p>With the special feature of you dont pay- they cut you off. This includes all your project files and your backups become completely dependent on your bank card(Cloud).</p>
                                        <p>Imagine purchasing a piano and you create a bunch of music- write your songs- you make your payments. Then one day, you say hold on a minute I bought this piano and the corporation says- "No more piano for you. You can never own the piano, you can only borrow it at a premium". </p>
                                        <p>Your work, projects, and songs are now locked in the program unless you pay. You can not remove them from the software because they are locked by extension- you could copy all of it one by one, note by note, out of the program to paper or the like - but only after you pay.</p>
                                        <p>This is what the Tech industry has done. This is what every corporate entity has ever done. Lease, debt, own nothing, pay forever, be happy.</p>
                                        <p>This is the route all tech is inevitably going and already has gone since it started in 2015.</p>
                                        <p>If you are using Windows 8-11 then you are already in that ecosystem. If the Software Corporations want their grants, funding, and partnership to remain in online stores, advertise, or merely exist: then they will promote the Corporation of Microsoft and push Microsoft products (hence add blocks by installer).</p>
                                        <p>As we see, all newer versions are simply blocked, they are not incompatible.</p>
                                        <p>I know many will say "If you dont like it just change companies." Which is what I am advocating (FabFilter, Recomended Daws). It sounds good on paper but the reality is this is ALL companies have or in the near future will adopt this route under Win 8-11+ policy or else they will be blocked by Microsoft/Apple/Google.</p>
                                        <p>Open Source will not be fully immune- Microsoft owns Github.</p>
                                        <p>The writing was on the walls years ago and today it is seen everywhere! Everything you do on YOUR Computer will cost $10 a month, at least! Any addons/plugins will cost extra. Anything you create will be reviewed ... all the while you are on a subscription based OS (Win 8-11) that can turn itself off, uninstall programs since it has full access, and shut down on you for whatever reason because you dont even own that or anything on it.</p>
                                        <p>Why do you think all of Win 8-10 was free?
                                            <br> Why do you think Win 11 is also free?</p>
                                        <p>If you value any freedom you have to roll back and go Legacy.</p>
                                        <p>Lets move on.</p>
                                        <header class="bible-content">
                                            <h5>Native Instruments</h5></header>
                                        <p> Native Instruments (being first in this breakdown) has already begun rolling out their's starting at $10/month.</p>
                                        <p>Expect that to rise as they expand the catalogue. However, they have simultaneously started rolling out OS limitation.</p>
                                        <p>With OS Limitation you have to freeze their installer version. If you have a perpetual license then you can activate. However, you will not be a able to install their installer with the new installer due to OS Limitation.</p>
                                        <p>You must freeze the previous installer version. Interesting note: none of their products are dependent in anyway on Win 8-10 or 11. ONLY the installer is dependent on Win 10+. What sense does that make?</p>
                                        <header class="bible-content">
                                            <h5>Waves</h5></header>
                                        <p>Waves is just like Native Instruments above and has begun rolling out their's starting at $8/month and as high as $20/month.</p>
                                        <p>Identical to NI and expect that to rise as they expand the catalogue. They have also started rolling out OS limitation.</p>
                                        <p>With their OS Limitation- anything new they make, you must have WIN 10+ to use- fine by me no temptation or care about anything else they make. I just saved 115% by switching to Windows 7.</p>
                                        <p>Like NI above, 99.9% of everything they offer (180 tools/products) is not dependent on Win 8-10+. With the exception of 2 of their new products and also you guessed it... the Installer.</p>
                                        <p>Do you see what is happening?</p>
                                        <p>You have to freeze their installer also/and if you have a perpetual license, then you can activate. However, you will not be a able to install their installer with the newer installer due to OS Limitation.</p>
                                        <p>This marketing should become very obvious.</p>
                                        <p>A product you can buy for a one time $40 License fee- will now cost you $10/month forever for a bundle that cost only $99 total.</p>
                                        <header class="bible-content">
                                            <h5>FabFilter</h5></header>
                                        <p>Keeps it simple and basic and I love them for it. Not only are their products top notch favorites of mine but they show the OS limitation is a market ploy to force transitions and bring in the corporate subscription scam.</p>
                                        <p>Why is it FabFilter is uneffected by all these tech changes? Maybe they actully care about their base... sounds like it.</p>

                        <p>The best option currently available and it only takes a few seconds for you to revolutionize your web experience.</p>
                        <p>You will not even realize that you left Chrome.
                            <br> You will not stop using the Chromium framework.
                            <br> Therefore the learning curve is non-existent and the familiarity is preserved.</p>
                        <p>Most importantly, your freedom is given back to you. An Open Sourced Chrome is now in your hands.</p>
                        <p>What is Brave? It is best answered by Brave themselves:<br> <a onclick="window.open('https://brave.com','popup','width=600,height=600'); return false;">To Download and Learn More</a></p>
                        <p>Now that you have downloaded Brave changing over to Brave is simple. Just export your bookmarks and personal info/passwords(if you use those features) and then import them into Brave, thats it.</p>
                        <p>It is so easily done that even the non-tech savvy can say goodbye to trackers, ads, and Google agents... to say hello Brave Search Engine! A complete alternative that is faster, more secure, and feature packed.</p> <span class="img-responsive img-circle center-block TechMainSW swt-TechSWBraveSearch">&nbsp;</span><br>
                        <p>Yes! Brave runs flawlessly on mobile devices as well. It can also be synced to other devices. Go from device to device and never lose your spot - securely and quickly.</p></section></div></section>

                            <h4>Proton Mail/VPN</h4></hgroup>
                        <p>Email which just so happens to double as a VPN: although I should probably say a VPN that doubles as an Email. Email is prob the more important Feature tho. Anyways.</p>
                        <p class="tc"><a onclick="window.open('https://pr.tn/ref/5972T1W4XRB0','popup','width=600,height=600'); return false;">ProtonMail and ProtonVPN.</a></p>
                        <p>ProtonMail is a company that values privacy. I believe everyone should know, use, and support them! All of the Proton features are encrypted and bundled so (like Google) one account syncs with everything Proton.</p>
                        <p>There is not too much to add here as it is just an Email and a VPN. I have come to discover that many people do not have a VPN or use a VPN (for what ever reason). I can only strongly suggest that they should.</p>
                        <p>As for what a VPN is and isn't? I will not cover that here - being a completely different topic. If you value privacy you should not be using Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc. Google employees and their affiliates, advertisers, sister corporations, friends, partners, agents, NSA, government, banks, anyone really - combs through your emails.</p>
                        <p>ProtonMail's encryption is End-to-End. This means the only people who can see your email messages are the sender and yourself. So why are you not using ProtonMail?</p>
                        <p>The VPN feature is free, so if you were not using one (for whatever reason) you are now!</p>
                        <p>Proton's services are unmatched! They honestly have zero competition at this stage in the game. In combination with Brave Browser, you can actually feel the protection like a blanket. The price range is from $0 (yes, actually free including the VPN) to Paid plans starting at $5 for Basic and $12 for Unlimited - both are super reasonably priced. Both provide a better user experience granting access to more servers meaning faster loading/download/upload. I would also like to mention that these packages come with ProtonBridge; which we will get into momentarily.</p>

                        <p>It is also important to mention that Brave also offers a VPN; which is built into Brave. Meanwhile, the cost is identical to ProtonVPN. Proton has far more value when bundled with Mail/Bridge. So this is one Brave feature Proton is just better and outbeats Brave.</p>
                        <p>A subscription worth the investment as Proton works on your Mobile too.</p></section></div></section>

                        <h4>CryptoWallets</h4></hgroup>
                    <p>Now we can move to the unfamiliar territory. If you chose Brave, you have already started this process. Crypto Wallet comes built directly into the Brave Browser.</p> <span class="img-responsive center-block TechAloneSW swt-TechSWBraveMeta">&nbsp;</span>
                    <p>Even though it is limited because it is only Ethereum based — and it only uses Wyre — a lot can be achieved through this Wallet. It is superb; especially if you are just getting started in the Crypto world. This replaces MetaMask and there is no need for an extension.</p>
                    <p>These features are whole programs that are used daily. I feel they are relevant enough to add them to the list.</p>
                    <hgroup class="bible-content">
                        <h5><a onclick="https://uphold.com/signup?referral=aeb7fe32a1','popup','width=600,height=600'); return false;">Uphold</a></h5></hgroup>
                    <p>If you are serious about Crypto or want to get an Official Crypto Wallet.</p>
                    <p>We can do this directly from the Brave Browser and Link. In this case you would create an Uphold account. This process will require verification (ID and typical financial information) because you are opening a Crypto Bank Account - which even offers a debit card. . I cover this topic in more detail within the "Crypto Talk" section.</p>
                    <p>Once you are verified you will have access to the entire Exchange; which has a PayPalish feeling and allows you to send and buy Crypto all on the fly.</p>
                    <p>This is the easiest format for those looking for a Crypto like PayPal exchange. You can then sync it to your Brave and receive your Brave Rewards (to tip or use as you like).</p>
                    <hgroup class="bible-content">
                        <h5>Into the Real World.</h5></hgroup>
                    <p>Uphold also offers a debit card as mentioned (like PayPal) so you can spend your Crypto whenever and wherever - even out and about or to pay bills at no extra charge wherever Visa/Mastercard is accepted.</p>
                    <p>This is secure, however, it is very personal with your name attached to it due to the fact this is a REAL Debit Card. This is not Crypto Anonnomity (see CryptoTalk for more on this). Of course, there are other Crypto alternatives but for the vast majority, this is the easiest and fastest way to jump in.</p>
                    <hgroup class="bible-content">
                        <h5>2FA</h5></hgroup>
                    <p>The reality is that this market is very small. It is useful but it is also a destructive double edge sword. I do not recommend this in general to the mass unless absolutely necessary - but I do not advocate against it as I use it religiously for many certain aspects.</p>
                    <p>My only recommendation is Authy - there are quite a few alternatives feel free to explore those options.</p>
                    <p>2FA is much like "Crypto Seeds", this information needs to be retrievable. If you lose this information unlike a basic password reset - you will not be resetting anything in 98% of cases, you will be starting over and anything you had including accounts, financial, records etc protected by 2FA - will be completely lost. Do take caution and store this information responsibly. Retrieving it by customer service is not always possible, as the verification process will be dreadful with not even a guarantee of restoration.</p>
                    <p>On the bright side - it gives a very real look at how secure 2FA is.</p></section></div>

                    <p>Hopefully it should be clear how powerful the Brave Browser is as a whole. As stated, Brave/Proton will completely revolutionize your browser experience.</p>
                    <p>Feature loaded and everything built in including encryption, search engine, access Dapps, a Crypto Wallet (Link straight to Uphold), Crypto Expansion, Tor (it works great but is not a replacement for Tor), and all this with nearly no learning curve what so ever.</p>
                    <p>Do not mistake this recommendation as a fanboy over or an attempt to hype the Brave Browser/Proton. No need to - although Brave nolonger offers Windows7 support - Brave Browser with Proton is simply, hands down an easy to use all around powerhouse available with no real need for any updates being a browser. Which easily and effortlessly also introduces the masses to alternative tech with practically one download and a simple setup of an account.</p>

                <p class="tc"><a onclick="window.open('https://signal.org/en/','popup','width=600,height=600'); return false;">Signal</a> and <a onclick="window.open('https://www.telegram.org/','popup','width=600,height=600'); return false;">Telegram</a>
                <br>They both sort of just co-exist.</p>
                <p>Signal is Open Sourced end-to-end encryption.
                <br>Telegram is not.</p>
                <p>Signal is a Prime DM/Text/Messenger(No longer an SMS Alternative-was its best feature).
                <br>Telegram is slightly better for groups, channels, and the like.</p>
                <p>Both require a phone number - Signal is great for friends, family, and those close to you being more personal.</p>
                <p>Telegram starts to out beat Signal in this regard when joining channels, groups, etc where the number can be hidden - albeit not secured - but hidden.</p>
                <p>Neither replace SMS(Closed Systems) - a pro/con of what made Signal so great to begin with.</p>
                <p><a onclick="window.open('https://discord.com','popup','width=600,height=600'); return false;">Discord</a> is better than both - however highly politically correct and censored. Minds has potential to be a solid alternative to Discord Server.</p>

                <br> Particular Social aspects.</p>
                <p>Gab will win across the board here with nearly 0 contest for many reasons.</p>
                <p>However, Minds has a more facebook feel - as well as offers alot more on Development, Tech, Fediverse connectivity, and Economical side of things, that makes it perfect for things such as NineNeins development.</p>
                <p>With that said GAB is still socially hands down unmatchable.</p>

                    <h5 class="tc">Default NineNeins Support Messenger/Server</h5></hgroup>
                <p><a onclick="window.open('https://getsession.org','popup','width=600,height=600'); return false;">Sessions</a> is Open Sourced end-to-end encryption. Anonymous, and No Phone number required.
                <br> This ensures NineNeins collects 0 information such as phone numbers, emails, etc.
                <br> As protects our Dev team from providing the same revealing information.</p>
                <p>Sessions is our recommendation and choice - with the only flaw being you will need to convert people to the platform.</p> 
                <p>Sessions and Minds together centralizes a foundation for a greater Discord alternative for NineNeins.</p></section>

                        <p>One of the most important softwares I use is Windows 7.
                        <wbr> Everything after Windows 7 is trash, anything before you shortchange yourself. 
                        <br>Just facts of life
                        <wbr> — anything that is bloated and has auto updates is not
                        <wbr> worth having. Indeed, many people seem to agree with me. I still have steady business reinstalling Win 7 on other's new computers.</p>
                        <p>Of course this is not a requirement...just a personal preference. Win7 is more secure, better all around, and works flawlessly - which is why I recommend it.</p>
                        <p>There are plenty of alternatives in the OS world- excluding Apple (avoid it like the plague). Most notable are BSD and Linux- which are alternatives - but I tend to avoid recommending them unless specific machining deems it necessary. Learning curves and all.</p>

                                            <h4>Details</h4></hgroup>
                                        <p>Windows 7 is extremely stable and everything just runs on it. This is just one of the greatest and many strengths of Win 7.</p>
                                        <p>The caveats of using Win 7 creates its weaknesses - most softwares being developed as I speak may cut support but you will notice that is not a problem at all. As for security this is not really an OS problem but the default program's problem (quick and ease of setups) although every software normally opens a port to dev for support and the like - in Win7's case all the defaults are Microsoft programs in which opens a port to Microsoft, plus the calls like any OS whether 7 or not, there is nothing nefarious going on here, every program does this - on Win7 as any OS the default programs just happen to be Microsoft or that OS. To remedy this simply change your default programs, update your host file, as this is where learning firewalls will be your best bet no matter what OS you choose. Only 8+ your computer will stop working if you do.</p>
                                        <p>At the end of the day all you need to do is Install and simply activate Win7 (by whichever method you prefer: whether toolkit or serial) and done.</p>
                                        <p>Congrats on your newly found freedom with Win 7. As many will claim it is better to use something other than Win 7 because of the default programs (that can be replaced, exchanged, blocked, and removed) I laid out for the average user - and they may even claim that the myth that Alts are safer.</p>
                                        <p>This is the key: the moment you connect to the internet every and any computer, device, etc. enters the very same threat level. Newer OS require a Constant connection to home base to operate. If that is the concern, do not connect to the Internet and remove all wireless hardware capabilities. This includes: Bluetooth, Wifi, etc. In my case I do not use Wifi for my computers (although both boards are capable of it). They are run via ether-net. This is important to harp on because no OS comes with Switch hardware - just saying.</p>
                                        <p>Of course this setup is not feasible for everyone; especially those on laptops (unless they remove their wifi chip - which sort of renders a laptop mostly useless). I again can only use myself as an example having a laptop(Win7) that does run Wifi and it has a purpose in the "Network". The point being vulnerabilities are not OS related - that's a port and call issue.</p>
                                        <p>The moment any OS/Computer connects to the Internet, you open a port. This has nothing to do with Win 7 or any other OS. Unlike Win 8-11/Apple where the same can not be said since both require a Port for everything from subscription, to updates, to well; operation. Yet, there is no software or such requirements built in Win-7 for auto updates, corporate control, remote, scan, access, verify, etc - on Win 7. (This was included in the final RollUp update of Win 7 and even there it was merely a popup.)</p>
                                        <p>All Win7 calls are deactivated so claiming "spyware" is comical.</p>
                                        <p>This is the the largest reason why everyone should dump Win 8-11 and avoid it as I stated earlier (including the last two updates for Win 7). A bonus is no more random updates.</p>
                                        <p>Win 7 is just much more safer (make it safer by makeing changes to your network settings) as any Alternative — however unlike the other alternatives- only on Win 7 is everything compatible, in the quite the literal sense everything installs, everything just works. I do personally run software that no other OS can accommodate and where Alternatives for me are just not up to par, will cover later. As this recommendation list is just common tools and nothing special in general only covering every aspect of NineNeins development — many things listed are mainstream. That is another one of Win 7s ultimate strengths.</p>
                                        <p>Here we are just taking the "mainstream" offline and turned it into an a giant New Open Source Alternative. Accomplished with ease and lets face it as simple as a basic install of Win7 out the box being one of the best upgrades you will ever do.</p>

                        <p>The Components include CCleaner and needs no introduction.</p>
                        <p>The only real alternative to CCleaner would be BleachBit, which is an Open Source - I personally use. As we jump to cover Duplicates with Duplicate Cleaner.</p>
                        <p>However, we will start off first with one many may be unfamiliar with but should def know about -Revo Uninstaller.</p>

                            <p>There is alot of overlap feature wise between the 4 programs, excluding Duplicate Cleaner - only Revo will allow us to go even deeper - far surpassing CCleaners uninstaller - yet nowhere close to CCleaners monitor, scan, and cleaning. As well as surpassing BleachBits registry deletion on uninstall - not BleachBits after uninstall. This should be your default Installer/Uninstaller.</p>
                            <p>Again, as CCleaner is named for monitoring and quick suite (Computer-Cleaner), BleachBit is named for Bleaching(or Wipeing), Revo Uninstallers name tells you exactly what it is and does (Installs and Uninstalls) - true uninstalls. Meaning, a ton of files get added to the registry with every install/uninstall you add and remove - which sit there in what is technically the graveyard of the computer for eternity due to nothing removes them (neither CCleaner/Bleachbit). This is where Revo Uninstaller shines tracing the Install and removing the traces - no-more having to play grave-keeper.</p>
                            <p>Although, as usual it comes with overlapping features such as "Evidence Remover"(Bleaching) and clean up(scan) it expands with access to Windows built-in tools which are powerful and often overlooked and scans built in for ease of access.</p>
                            <p>For a price of $30 and what it does; its a steal and that includes a portable to always have on hand.</p>
                            <p>Bulk Crap Uninstaller is a SOLID alternative. Open Source and Free. If you notice I didn't compare them, because Bulk Crap Uninstaller is just as good just not as beginner friendly as Revo.</p>

                            <p>CCleaner is a Freemium option (if you desire)- or $30. This can come to an end or "OS" incompatible if you run older OS.</p>
                            <p>The take away here is that CCleaner is not expensive for what it does and everything it does being a FlagShip. Essentially what I am saying is getting a back up copy now would be a wise choice. Although not at all really required - unless you want auto processes.</p>
                            <p>With that out of the way, CCleaner is a phenomenal piece of software that will not require all the updates that come with the Lease-Perpetual License because these particular softwares are tuned into the computers OS preferences - not cloud. That is critical to understand and keep in mind with all Software!!!</p>
                            <p>Meaning, even when your version expires (either Update License or by OS)... the License simply covers the "Download" and subscription to update for that Particular Version, not the program itself. This may change when in future updates with restructuring "OS"folders/names/locations in future updates. Essentially— it is a one time purchase that does not require the license to run and acts more as an Open Source donation for the time being — rather than a Corporate Software.</p>
                            <p>So why bother with BleachBit?</p>
                            <p>So now lets look to BleachBit being an Open Source that does not have the license/download dilemma; also lacks the possible OS limitations that would require version rollback for now - as unlike CCleaner will add Linux systems into the equation - as well as a portable, already you can see all the features BleachBit is bringing to the table.</p>
                            <div class="clear"></div>
                            <p>Since it is Open Source, the OS limitation is not a problem (if it had ever been a problem). It is not limited by corporate pressure of Microsoft or any other's will. Anybody, can tweak update, modify, build, design etc their version of BleachBit. BleachBit also surpasses CCleaner in many regards; especially when we get into system jumps, portables, deletion, and features compared to CCleaner(Freemium). Although CCleaner(non-freemium) does outperform and surpass BleachBit across the functionality spectrum.</p>
                            <p>At Cost BleachBit is Champion, Portability Winner, Linux/Win Winner. Yet, if Win and you want the Auto Suite (automatically runs and cleans in background) CCleaner will become Champion.</p>
                            <p>This helps to really differentiate between the two programs and highlight their strengths and weaknesses - Also show how 2 programs doing essentially the same thing are Radically different and both just as Important.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h5>Things Considered</h5>
                            <br>
                            <p>These four softwares really do compliment one another and are four different tools for four different purposes. Although they may all overlap having two options for specific task is always better than 1, having four overlapping is convenient. This assuredly can become simply a personnel preference or possibly system choice - although they are all very different softwares - all are technically free.</p> 
                            <p>All are also worthy of support, meaning just because BleachBit and BulkCrap Uninstaller don't have price tags - as Revo(basic features) and CCleaner(updates/support) dont essentially require purchase, doesn't mean you shouldn't consider saying thanks for the uh'mazing software's. CCleaner and Revo are both technically free also 1 is simply proprietary and one is open source.</p> 
                            <p>All four are absolute treasures.</p>
                            
                            <p>Finally, the final aspect in maintenance - the tedious duplication's.</p>

                                        <h4 class="panel-title tc">

                            <p> Here's where Duplicate Cleaner truly takes the lead on Windows. There are several rivals; CCleaner is one of them (yes, those over-lapping features again) - fewer Open Source. As I must admit this is one section I have spent very little time with in open source world.</p> 
                            <p>Considering Duplicate Cleaners simplicity of use and performance specially if you have ever dealt with Duplicate files then you know it is an absolute steal at a one time $40 price tag. This is def the go to and best option to have on hand if duplication's are the target. Duplicate Cleaner is one of a couple softwares you can throw a little money at a problem, and the problem goes away.</p>
                            <p>There is also the basic feature set that is free and may be all one needs for basic needs.</p>
                            <p class="tc">In closing when it comes to Maintenance these five programs are all anyone would really ever need no matter how complex the development or basic your needs ranging from 0(freemium)-200 dollars. Just to highlight the value these five software's hold and worth every penny. Support Great Developments and Teams. Here are 5 of them.</p>

                        <h4>Crucial Sides</h4></hgroup>
                        <p>Things many don't consider and overlook miss out on so much Power.<br>
                        TreeSheets and FontForge are intricate hidden hands. As TinyMM is like having an intern to organize and beautify the library.</p>
                    <hgroup>
                        <h5>Media Player</h5></hgroup>
                        <p>I am a massive fan of Windows Media Player for Audio it is my default everything Audio. However, everyone knows there are a ton of Media Players trying to get noticed doing things WMP doesn't, many great ones too. Such as being set to the Noti tray. Enter RBTray - like magic stubborn programs like WMP are hidden to the Noti Tray.</p>
                        <p>While on WMP TinyMM again comes into play making the Library Gorgeous which will work with any Library. I do however, use KMPLayer as my default for everything Video for the Frameless while working which has RbTray built in.</p>
                    <hgroup>
                        <h5>Icons</h5></hgroup>
                        <p>This little gem is one I am not even sure how I came about it but I sure am glad I did. This little portable software is tiny and powerful. Best I have ever encountered. Simply makes creating icons drag and drop straight on the desktop. Purely phenomenal.</p> 
                    <hgroup>
                        <h4>CPU-Z</h4></hgroup>
                        <p>Needs no introduction. Meanwhile I decided what better leader to put all the dependable backup software's into. So a quick and brief rundown of those is in order.</p>
                    <hgroup>
                        <h5>Win-Rar</h5></hgroup>
                        <p>Love it or hate it - I love it. When it comes to archiving and storing there is no competition. Is a must have in my book.</p>
                    <hgroup>
                        <h5>LockHunter</h5></hgroup>
                        <p>A genius developed this treasure. Ever get that cant close because open in another program but you cant find it? A simple right click, content menu, LockHunter.. done. I wish I was exagerating, really thats it your done, close the program you were trying to.</p>
                    <hgroup>
                        <h5>RightClickE</h5></hgroup>
                        <p>There are a ton of great Content Menu editors and all of them are pretty good for basics. I happen to be a Content Menuer User. I like being able to put everything and anything I need one right click away. RightClickE makes that possible, albeit will take some tweaking and patience but afterall we are doing deep customization here.</p>
                    <hgroup>
                        <h5>AquaSnap</h5></hgroup>
                        <p>Its a simple free windower that just works amazingly. Set it and forget it.</p>
                    <hgroup>
                        <h5>LightShot</h5></hgroup>
                        <p>Quick Screenshots on the fly. Again one of those it works works flawlessly.</p>
                    <hgroup>
                        <h5>Mp3Tag</h5></hgroup>
                        <p>One of those you dont know you need it, until you need it. But, when you do need it there it is sitting there in your content menu.</p>
                    <hgroup>
                        <h5>AdvRenamer</h5></hgroup>
                        <p>I have only needed to use this maybe 2-3 times ever. The first time was a nightmare trying everything in the world. The second half as aggravating trying to get the hang of it. The third time was so nice, I cant wait til I have an opputuinity to use it again but when I do there it is also in the Content Menu waiting.</p> 
                    <hgroup>
                        <h5>TurboTop</h5></hgroup>
                        <p>Again, one of those I hardly use - but super convenient and always running in background when you need it for that 5-10 minutes you need to TurboTop something when buried in folders and windows.</p>
                    <hgroup>
                        <h5>PowerIso</h5></hgroup>
                        <p>When you need to reinstall or make a new build look no further.</p>
                    <hgroup>
                        <h5>KeePass</h5></hgroup>
                        <p>Protect your Passwords. For trivial stuff Brave/Proton can both handle passwords. However, if you want more secure as well as your own network - KeePass got you covered.</p></section></div></section>
