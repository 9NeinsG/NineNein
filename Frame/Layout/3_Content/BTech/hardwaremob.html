                                <p>Nothing here is required - nearly half of it is discontinued anyways. There are no affiliates, nor sales pitch, nor must gets. This information is simply to convey My Setup being one of those questions that get asked constantly. I believe because they many look at what I am working on and think you need some super duper over the top setup do do it. There is nothing special it is really just a basic setup.</p> 
                                <p>I was going to originally put it in "Creation" and in each SetUp section for FashCode, FashPhoto, and FashAlong topics but I feel like that would have ended up sending a mixed message.</p>
                                <p class="tc">However, my setup is overkill for 99%. So decided to just put it here in "HardWare" for a reference since it has no particular relevance.</p>

                <p>Lets start with one of the most solid Boards in personal experience : which is the Intel-DH77KC in which although tops out at 32Gig Ram - a Board from personal experience ran 24/7 for 11 years and is still going strong to confidently use to demonstrate MotherBoards in general Last a Long Time.</p> 
                <p>As 32 Gigs of Ram is Plenty for almost anybody, for almost every reason, and will with flying colors perform any task you can dream of, want, or need - from Adobe to Protools and everything in between all the way to Z.</p>
                <p>Only Limit will be high intense Rendering and PC Gameing.</p>
                <p>It is mentioned here due to it being a personal favorite : which is most likely due to being around and so trustworthy for so long and to serve as the baseline I can confidently use to show everything a MotherBoard needs.</p>
                <p>Why is this relevant? These old Boards do EVERYTHING all the New Boards do at pennies on the penny - you can quickly throw together a Mini-Pc for travel, to save space in close spaces, serve as a Media Server, Create a Digital Studio for practically nothing, in any field - Quite literally whatever you want!</p> 
                <p>Instead of forking over cash endlessly for devices, with this Basic Surface Information you will have everything you will need to make your own, convert it to something else, make another, create a system network, etc.</p>
                <p>Fun Fact this is all Corporations do btw then turn around and sell it as a product for you to buy.</p>

                    <h5 class="bh tc">Infrastructure :</h5></hgroup>
                <p>On Newer Boards all that has changed in all these years are the Sockets, Ram Capability such as DDR4/DDR5 and Total Size, Upgraded connections such as USB3/M.2, and more solidly built PCI ; strengthened for graphic cards and the like - not to mention the Bios/Architecture(Etc).</p>
                <p>That is really it - over generalized. Sounds like alot however its not nearly as much as it sounds. For example Everything and Anything you could do on ANY New Board, you can do with a Classic Board like the Intel-DH77KC mentioned above which today retails New($170) which is a 2nd/3rd generation(Intel).</p> 
                <p>So don't think just because the New Boards are New that means they are superior - they are not in a practicality sense. They are technically due to they have a few upgrades for speed at the premium of cost, and some nice cooling - which is not even noticeable in 90% of cases, and faster transfer(technically).</p>
                <p>Technology overall has not changed AT All, only improved slightly.</p>

                <p>The power in every Generation of Chip is Incredible! Let me attempt to put this in perspective, by stating Entire Productions from Disney to Paramount were made with these old Boards and CPUS, Soundtracks and Sony Albums were recorded using these old Boards and CPUS, which they paid top dollar for at the time - the same top dollar you pay for Modern Computers today.</p> 
                <p>Yet, This is simply the last 10 years we are talking about here - with nearly perfect IDENTICAL Architecture we are talking about - however, that is not really accurate or fair to say ; so lets change that terminology from Architecture to Framework instead. There are Massive improvements no doubt - but at the very core : these are more conveiance, aesthetics, and overall speed/performance - but not massive changes in reality.</p>
                <p>To sum it up in a single sentence. In 90% of cases this amount of production is unnecssary and is purely luxury.</p>

                    <h5 class="bh tc">Limit Laws :</h5></hgroup>
                <p>Much like buying a Brand New Car only the 2012 model - instead of paying for the Brand new 2022.</p>
                <p>What does the 60 Thousand+ dollar 2022 Car have or do - that the 2012 doesn't?</p> 
                <p>Both use the same fuel, oil, tires, same generic fabrics, radios, features, radiators, alternators, etc.</p>
                <p>Surely someone will say it goes Faster! And they would be wrong - for the "infrastructure" has this thing called a speed limit which is bounded to 25/Neighborhood, 45-55/highways, and maxed out at 70/Interstate.</p> 
                <p>Anything faster is overkill and illegal to use - essentially you paid way to much for that brand new 2022 - which simply added on to the dash display 140-180 MPH in 2012 most were 120-140 MPH... - but what difference at all does that make? None!</p>
                <p>Will still do all the errands, reach the same destinations, although your insurance would be cheaper for you wont need full coverage.</p>
                <p>Technology is identical. For instance just because you have the latest Internet Capability does not mean you have better Internet, it will determine on infrastructure and a provider that offers those speeds - as you will also pay a much higher monthly *Insurance* rate to use it. The question here simply comes down to how much are you willing to pay?</p>
                <p>If you exceed those speed limits in your car a cop pulls you over and you get a ticket with a fine/worse. In Tech you pay the ticket up front every month which creates an overhead - my how that New Expensive Computer cost money to simply run at marketing specs - didn't know you were buying new bills huh. Those same internet speeds dont care what board you use.</p>
                <p>Imagine how much you could have saved driving the Brand New 2012. If you want a Porsche, Audi, or Lamborghini - fantastic get a 2012 model. Simply add your 5 dollar lights and throw some paint on it, Noone will ever know.</p>
                <p>With this information lets build that computer.</p></section></div></section>

                        <p class="tc">A MotherBoard is a MotherBoard<br>Images below for a :<br>Gen 3 (Used $30-$120 / New $170)<br> vs<br>a Gen 10($130-$250).</p> 
                        <span class="img-responsive center-block TechSW swt-TechHWBoard">&nbsp;</span>

                        <p>I know what you are thinking... "but the New Board is not much more than the Old Board" - which is true if the Classic Board is purchased as New ; which only demonstrates my point that a MotherBoard is a MotherBoard.</p> 
                        <p>There are perfectly good Boards everywhere for free to a few dollars and up online.</p> 
                        <p>The New Boards however will require that New Processor(CPU-Socket) which means you are looking at $200-$550 out the door each - Board/Ram not included.</p>

                        <p>With this Generation information in more clarity instantly we will be able to see the conveniences, aesthetics, speed, and overall performance of the Latest MotherBoard(Carbon - Imaged) will essentially come down to the cooling factors, Socket, and RAM capabilities.</p>
                        <p class="tc">Lets get RAM/Memory out the way real quick. before jumping into Sockets. This is a defining aspect.</p> 
                        <hgroup class="bible-content">
                            <h5 class="bh">Ram</h5></hgroup>
                        <p>When it comes to RAM this is Where the Newer Boards like the Carbon really shine being 128gb of RAM - however, cost wise to max out the MSI Carbons Ram or any 128gb Board for that matter will hover around $400 or $100 each slot. Again thats 128gb, which is in blatant terms an absurd amount of Ram.</p>
                        <p>This of course will add on an extra 400 dollar pricetag out the gate to the MotherBoard - and you don't even have the Processor(CPU). Which will bring the MotherBoard, CPU, and RAM to near an avg of about $1000 and we are just getting started with the build - which is obviously the contrary to building a Cheap and Powerful computer.</p>

                        <p class="tc">Do you really need 128gb of Ram?<br> Unless you are doing complex productions/projects the answer is NO.</p>

                        <p>Lets come back to reality now and save hundreds of dollars by sticking to 8, 16, and 32gb of Ram. Keep in mind this opens the entire generational line as options - even the Newer boards for you dont have to max out the RAM if you may want to upgrade later.</p>
                        <p>The Options and possibilities across the Intel Generations are endless : just keep in mind the only limitation here now is going to be the CPU Socket.</p>
                        <p>Building Dream Machines does not have to be a money-pit. There is so much amazing, powerful tech just laying around free of charge in many cases.</p>

                        <p> Although, the i-3, i-5, i-7 which are easily found in the wild(Free-$100), and i-9 are options which is R3, R5, R7, and R9 on the Ryzen side ; these are all constant variables. Here I will focus on the Generational I-7(top Intel til I-9 came out aka 9thGen which will render only 2 Sockets to choose from). This is to give a very realistic look at what I am trying to convey here.</p> 
                        <p>All in all there are 5 different Main-Sockets so in general there are only 5 MotherBoards to choose from. Everything else is Extra and I/O fit to your build.(Excluding AMD for clarity but applies equally - mirror image just as I-7 &amp; R-7).</p>

                        <p>Like Ram - Not every build needs a graphic card(we have not even covered yet and wont) and not every build needs more than an i-3 - in fact depending on purpose of the computer in many cases a Celeron Chip has more power than most will ever need - but at the avg Prices it becomes more economically conscious to stay in the Igen-CPUs(I's & R's).</p>
                        <p>This is not to downplay Celeron. So much can be done and built with Celerons and are very useful, powerful, as recommended for many builds, not to mention easily collected for free from most generic computers - to keep in the arsenal for Multi builds and task specific.</p>
                        <p>Celeron is also Socket Specific.</p>

                            <h5 class="bh">Switch</h5></hgroup>
                        <p>For example when they give you the "Gameing" pitch - the Nintendo Switch(for sake of reference on mass scale) is an ARM 4 Cortex-A57 with cores @ 1.02 GHz aka Tegra X1. Have you seen the price of a Nintendo Switch? It is 1/3rd the Cost of most Graphic Cards let alone the processor(CPU).</p>
                        <p>What if I told you the Processor inside of the Nintendo Switch is 2012 or Gen 3 for reference? What if I doubled down and showed you in 2014 AMD announced the Opteron A1100 intended for Servers, the A1100 has "four or eight" Cortex-A57(2012) cores, support for up to - 128gb of DDR3 or DDR4 RAM {Sound Familiar}. 128gb Ram was available in 2012 with specific chips... if you scroll back up to the chart you will see 128gb ram is 9thGen Tech(2017). Inwhich the A1100 series was released 4 years later in January 2016. It all makes sense when you realize the Switch was released 2017 by our standard here(8thGen) using "2012"(3rd Gen) tech in a Gen 10-12 market.</p>
                        <p>Quick recap : The Nintendo Switch today is still the highest selling Game Device in 2022(a Decade), released 2017, using 2012 technology. Where is this "New Tech"? Release of impletation does not make it new - it makes it available.</p>
                        <p>One more quick point to make the bigger point. The only "New Tech" is the same as the original concern of "Old Tech" which is selling you a subscription to play games or access softwares, files, etc ; that were on pre-Gens ; now with a subscription. You can play, use, access, as long as you pay - but you can never own and only borrow - when you stop paying you also stop playing. Which is exactly what Win8+ is all about with creating this "EcoSystem" which is short for Economy aka Apple on steroids. If one wanted to join a cult of permission that was their choice - the dystopia is many are accepting this new subscription slave mentality and calling it "NewTech". Nothing New at all about it.</p>
                        <p>Now lets flip back to Computers not Game Devices.</p></section>

                        <p class="tc">A 1st Generation MotherBoard. The ASUS P7F7-E.
                        <span class="img-responsive center-block CodeSW swt-TechSW1stBoard">&nbsp;</span>When we compare the 1st generation from 2009 to the Latest Generation 2021 of MotherBoards - I chose a Board that displays the Connections.</p>
                        <p>Keep in mind this is an Original(1st) I-Generation Board/Socket. So lets go back to the 3rd vs 10th and compare the Processor between the Second Gen(3rdGen i-7 CPU) Socket and a 5th Gen(10thGen i-7 CPU) Socket</p>
                        <p>Keep in mind overall the new 12th Gen is just as Identical to 10th Gen only with a new Cache or L4 Cache to be precise. Now, lets look at the cost and sum up building a Cheap but Powerful Computer - we have a Gen3 I-7(Free-$60) and a MotherBoard(Free-$160) at nowhere near the cost of the the Gen10 I-7 alone; not including Board. Granted you can get classic Boards as low as $30-$60 or even free if one scavenges, you will pay roughly around same price as new Board if new/retailer - the point being made here is every motherBoard is nearly identical across generations. You may be thinking you are losing out on this deal. Truth is you have paid nothing to very little for the core price of a Computer - maxing out Ram should not be a problem, in the case of our BaseLine(1st/3rdgens) are normally 32gb(4-8gb) avg $80 or $20 a Slot. You can practically choose any Graphic Card at this point if that is your desire to have in the build practically for Free.</p>
                        <p>Back then you would have had one of the coolest, fastest, top of the line epic computers on the Block. Today you would still have one of the coolest, fastest. epic computers on the block. With CPU speeds not even noticeable with basic usage, nearly non noticeable with mid usage, but the performance will begin to show in Hard Usage which strains a system in which 90% of people will never need to worry about and most dont even put a dent in 8gb of RAM ; for those that do... wouldnt even know what to do with 16gb RAM - if in doubt I guarantee 32gb RAm is overkill. Why then even consider spending $400 on RAM? Celeron is marketed and sales due to this very reason.</p>

                <p>With the MotherBoard, Ram, and CPU/Sockets understood. We move into the last major component of the IO which will extend into PS2.</p>
                <p>This is really simple and basic stuff - for more complex there are cards but we wont be getting into that being a build specific niche. The driver per Input(FireWire &amp; Midi) is determined by device - the Output is pretty much standard(HDMI, USB and B[Printer]).</p></section></div><br>

                            <h5 class="bh">The IO</h5></hgroup>
                        <p>The IO is the back panel or any panel that connects. This is simply the Input(I) and Output(O). An example would be if you connect your Screen(Monitor) the image shows up because the signal is being Output to the Screen(Monitor), a Headphone Jack is another perfect example.</p>
                        <p>The Mouse and Keyboard are normally Inputs.</p>
                        <p>USB and these type of cords are normally both - an Input to put Data(Files) onto the Computer, but can act as an Output if transferring files from Out of the Computer and Into an external Drive or mobile device.</p>
                        <p>Very basic stuff.</p>
                        <p>When we take a close look we can see how old all this tech really is and one must ask where are all the "Technological Advances" - normally sold as New. "New Techs" are normally just a connector like USBA(Common), USBB(PrinterPort), and then there is USBC(C-Port). That is all USB-C basically is - a connector which was around practicality since the very beginning. Which is technically just Lightening Port in which is just Apple Corporate terminology for C-Port which features an outie(Male) - and not an inny(Female).</p>
                        <p>To be fair the C-port seems to be one of the largest technological advances in the view of at least marketed that way - the flaw being one will still need a docking station... uh oh... so instead of hooking straight to the back of computers IO - you are essentially just moving the IO to your desk for whatever reasoning I will never understand. Wow, such technology - so why even have built in IO at all.</p>
                        <p>Lets pause and let that concept marinate - seriously ; really look at the implications here and realize thats how you get locked out and into a subscription asking permission to use your own IO and paying extra for Corporate IO devices(Docks). Essentially selling the IO separate from the MotherBoard - "Technological Advances" *hand quotation marks*. I can already hear the Naysayers kvetching "Thats not possible" - as I present the Nintendo Switch once again as exhibit 1. </p> 
                        <p>In Software part of this blog when demonstrate and explain the implementing of this subscription garbage as well as recommendations once we build our PC - it is not just Software going subscription - it is Hardware also. Enough clarification lets get back to it.</p>
                        <p>That Nintendo Switch Dock is $60, which features an IO with the USB-C AC(Power), HDMI(Video), and two USB(Ports) for pro-controllers built in. If you want the Cords included that price jumps to $120.</p> 
                        <p>This is where you see the $20 versions come to life ; for all the Dock(IO) is are plugs in a plastic body that holds the Device. Thats it!</p>
                        <p>Tinbinx has one for $25. Which does the exact same thing at a price of well done - not a plug nor an affiliate just a reference. Which should show you how basic and cheap you can build an IO.</p>
                        <p>However, when you hear the sales pitch from Corporations about saving space on a MotherBoard you can bet they will have a similar Dock release which will require some kind of authentication such as the Nintendo Shop. Although it may be true IO is thru-and-thru, yet you know they will add some sort of connectivity(Driver), that has software that needs to be installed(App), which will require verifying your system(Authentication).</p> 
                        <p>By now I hope you can understand the relevancy and dangerous waters here.</p>
                        <p>None of this is new and NONE of this has any affect on the MotherBoard or the IO(connectors), performance, style, aesthetics, etc - technically any MotherBoard in the Intel Generation can be theoretically used for EVERYTHING - including every connector. The Only current Lock here is the Socket.</p>

                            <p>Lets hit Amazon and take a moment and compare it to premade Modern "Gameing" computers today. Now compare the price side by side - look at the Specs. There is quite literally not a single upgrade you can not add except for the little boost in speeds(CPU bound) here moving up the generations and there(DDR4 starts at 4th Gen CPU which is a Third Gen Socket).</p>
                            <p>I know that USB3 connection/and all the "new stuff" is driving you crazy but what exactly is "new" ? When you can simply buy the PCI adapters for $30(Fab)-$60(StarTech) and install it. Wahla, USB3 and all the goodies. Aren't you fancy. How much Large File Transfer do you do anyways?</p> 
                            <p>There are PCI for nearly everything from FireWire to Thunder, etc - save one for a Graphic Card if you wanted or needed one in your build, you have plenty of funds for it now.</p>
                            <p>Just avoid the Ps/2 PCI they are USB reliant - not a big concern on older Boards due to all classic generations come with Ps/2 to my knowledge.</p>
                        <hgroup class="bible-content">
                            <h5 class="bh">Ps/2 True</h5></hgroup>
                            <p>The processor(CPU) is not that good for something in 2 years you can pick up for practically nothing. See Specs above for recap - CPU depends on Socket - Socket determines the Board, Board calls on CPU that fits Socket. Really it all comes down to the IO and expanded by PCI with whatever you want except Ps/2. This is something that if it is not on the IO you should be very wary.</p>
                            <p>These Ps/2 connections are industry standard.
                            I have failed to find a Board that couldn't run a Graphic Card, and 2 Pci for connections such as FireWire(or the like) which are driver driven - meaning the only thing to watch for is the Ps/2 port - these are those classic Green/Purple ports - today they are called Game ports and are Red or Black ; or Combo which are the multi-color port Half Green and Half Purple which you will need a Y-Cable splitter, then the Basic 2 port Green and Purple.</p>
                            <p>This Port is a darling you don't want to lose. Adding a Ps/2 card is not a true Ps/2 port, all USB Ps/2 are not TRUE Ps/2 ports for cards. add ons, etc and all USB makes the Ps/2 USB/Driver reliant. A True Ps/2 port is Ps/2 not USB!</p>
                            <p>To demonstrate this and show just how valuable this port is and that I am not just hyping you up and not agrreing with your favorite youtuber(corporate salesmen) and going against the grain - lets look at this Brand NEW motherBoard : The ASUS ROG Maximus Z690 Apex, which is an +$800 motherBoard with support for 12th Gen Intel Alder Lake chips, DDR5 RAM, and PCIe 5.0 connectivity. Now why would something so New, Latest, Greatest, Top Of The 2022 Line State of the ART - notably include a COMPLETE set of two color-coded PS/2 ports.</p>
                            <p>Who would want this "archaic", "old", and "outdated tech"? Why would they want it in this digital age of such Tech Supremacy? Let alone pay for it? Keep in mind everything said thus far across the entire spectrum.</p> 
                            <span class="img-responsive center-block CodeSW swt-TechSWPS2Board">&nbsp;</span>
                            <br>
                            <p>Ps/2 does not require drivers of any kind and without it installing Windows7 on Boards without Ps/2 is impossible for drivers are required for USB. When you connect a USB keyBoard to the PC, for example, a driver must tell the computer what you are connecting to that port and they will not be found because they wont be installed.</p> 
                            <p>However, when you connect a keyBoard/mouse to a Ps/2 port the PC knows that it is a keyBoard without needing to be told in any way. This means that a keyBoard/mouse connected to this port will always work, regardless of whether you are in the BIOS and/or what ever operating system you are using.</p>
                            <p>Ps/2 always works. In addition to the above, when you boot the PC the Ps/2 port loads even before the BIOS or processor data, and it literally has the power to interrupt CPU instructions. This means that it always works, no matter what you do, until you turn off the power. For this reason it is ideal for BIOS updates, firmware loads, and basically whatever you need - nothing else competes.</p>
                            <p>Ps/2 is inviolable . All of the above also means that it is inviolable. You cannot remotely access a Ps/2 peripheral in any way as there is no firmware, driver, or software involved. It is pure and hard hardware.</p>
                            <p>It has Full N-Key Rollover support . The famous feature of gaming keyBoards that allows to press as many keys simultaneously as we want without getting cluttered is inherent in Ps/2 ports. For this reason, many professional gamers prefer to use these types of ports instead of conventional USB.</p>
                            <p>Why are they taking it away - read this Ps/2 section again.</p>
                            <p>Ps/2 means you can opt out of upgrades, install Windows 7 or any thing you want to use, and never be corporate driver reliant. It is freedom to do whatever you want to do.</p>

                            <p>So if you building your first PC or merely interested in the topic this is all one needs to really understand.</p> 
                            <p>At this point We have a Gen3 I-7, A MotherBoard, 32GB of RAM, USB3, +add your customization's topping off at the cost of 1 single New Generation CPU. Also you have the ENTIRE tech market to choose from - just keep the 5 Main MotherBorad Sockets in mind.</p>
                            <p>Before we move on to Modernity. One has to ask what is the real reason you need a computer? If it is looks well spend away - if its actually building, infrastructure, studio, network, creation, etc... when all is added up you can build 4 Maxed out Custom Consoles for the price of 1 Modern Computer.</p>
                            <p>So lets put this in perspective by placing these side by side again. Below is a "New" and an "Old".</p>
                            <p>All you need now is a case, cooling, fans, and power supply - but these are quite generic and standardized and now you have no reason to cheap out here as I will say Noctua(Cooling/Fans) and Corsair(Power Supply) you can never go wrong with - which shouldn't be a problem with all the savings.</p>
                            <p>Such as imaged is a YYEYIAN Blade 2101 Gaming PC Case which you can get if you want for $54.99<br>
                                The Graphic Card is the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 will set you back $500<br>
                                The M.2 drive will cost about $100<br>
                                16gb of Ram is around $50<br>
                                The Water Cooler by looks is between $90-150<br> 
                                The fans are ?? ?? ... not Noctuas<br>
                            As Power Supply is not mentioned by Brand like everything else which is off putting... but giving the benefit of the doubt the same specs from Corsair and completely modular goes for around $150.</p> 
                            <p>So what are we exactly getting for $975 + fans that can be used with any Version, any Generation, and any Computer if you wanted exactly this $1000 shopping list?</p>
                            <p>This is not pocket change - this is serious CASH!</p>
                            <p>These can also be scavenged although the Noctuas will be extremely rare Freebies... the Corsair power supplies you be surprised, and along with case(opens the niche market up) will Modernize your build to the degree when someone sees it they will never know it was an Old Computer - what they will know is its Brand New, Fast, and Fully Loaded. What they wont know is you paid nearly nothing for it and you have 4 of these Beast to their one. Each slammed packed to squeeze every drop of performance from your gear with all the modern conveniences without breaking the bank.
                            </p>    
                            <p>Before moving on to Modernity. One has to ask what is the real reason you need a computer? If it is looks well spend away - if its actually building, infrastructure, studio, network, creation, etc... You can build 4 Maxed out Custom Consoles for the price of 1 Modern Computer.</p>
                            <p>Computers are extremely simple to put together, quite literally just pop it together, and you live in a landfill of High Powered Tech, all you have to do is put it back together.</p>

                        <h5 class="bh">Bricks</h5></hgroup>
                        <p>If you do not feel comfortable just jumping in and building away. Bricks are always an option too - from Hp/Dell which are out the box $200 build tanks most with 8-16gb. Here you know all the gear has been tested and works. As far as customization goes you will have to take it apart, some of them are Fantastic Builds with wide motherBoard I/O options. I would recommend opening it up and updating the RAM. Normally if you get an 8gb one it will have 2-4gb sticks, a 16 will normally have 2-8gb.</p>
                        <p>So aim for 16gb Brick so you only need to purchase 2-8gb - and not 4 of them to max out the 32 RAM.</p>
                        <p>Again, corporations know what I am telling you but they do not advertise it - gee I wonder why.</p>

                        <p>New and Solid - I never suggest Wifi but its included option built in.</p>
                        <p>The MSI Carbons run away with my recommendation here when it comes to New Boards.
                        Not only can they do DDR4 128Gig Ram, meet any and all configurations, but the cost for what these Boards can do and do  Extremely well, is Whoa. The caveats arent with the Board its just the shear cost of what comes along with it.</p> 
                        <p>The (AMD) MSI Carbon B450 Max and the (Intel) MSI Carbon Z490 MPG.<br>
                        I am speaking in the mid 100$ range.</p> 
                        <p>When choosing a Board the 3 most critical things to look for are :</p>
                        <p class="tc">
                        1.Socket - Processor(CPU)<br>
                        2.Ram/Memory - Type(Gen Issue), Max Size, and Speed<br>
                        ( two slots is Fine for most builds - 
                          four Slots is recommended for High Intensity Processing.)<br>
                        3.Connections - Really standard here - I do recommend keeping eye on Ps/2 ports.</p> 
                        <p>This is really all that is crucial to the MotherBoard.
                        A more expensive Board is almost never better as demonstrated in the previous section. There is nearly no reason to pay much over a hundred dollars on a motherBoard. Unless for specific reasoning.</p>
                        <p>When it comes to Ram this is Where the Newer Boards really shine - you can max out the MSI Carbons and any 128gb Board for around $400 or $100 each slot. Again thats 128gb which is in blatant terms an absurd amount of Ram.</p> 
                        <p class="tc">Between Board 160 + Processor(CPU) around 300 + MaxRam about $400 = $860. As these Boards introduce M.2 which start at $80-$200 each raising that New to just over a $1000.</p> 
                        <p>Just to demonstrate how fast things on this side will add up - you have not even got Cords, Harddrives, Cooling, Fans, Case, or Power Supply yet. Let alone Monitor, KeyBoard, Mouse, Audio - kiss that KVM goodbye. Here we can quickly see this is def not feasible to create all sort of computers, servers, devices, etc.</p>
                        <p>Keep in mind that absurd amount of Ram is not at all required for most computers range between 2-8gb, with 8gb being nice ; 16gb being classified Upgrade ; and 32 being the old Standard MaxedOut - which is now 1 of 4 or 32gb x 4slots = 128gb... Just saying 128gb is whoa. The M.2 is not required at all. The amount you settle on is up to you and hopefully I have given a visual of just how much or little the new Boards will run you but everything is optional and purely customizable as can be added at any time.</p>
                        <p>The processor(CPU) is not that good for something in 2 years you can pick up for practically nothing. See Specs above for recap - CPU depends on Socket - Socket determines the Board, Board calls on CPU that fits Socket. Really it all comes down to the IO and expanded by PCI with whatever you want except Ps/2. This is something that if not on IO be very wary.</p>
                        <p>Finally, connections - these are nearly industry standard.
                        I have failed to find a Board that couldn't run a Graphic Card, and 2 Pci for connections such as FireWire(or the like) - meaning the only thing to watch for is the Ps/2 port these are the classic Green/Purple ports - today they are called combo/game ports and are Red/Black but if nothing else aim for multi-color port or better get Boards that have Both.</p>
                        <p>This Port is a darling you don't want to lose. Adding a Ps/2 card is not a true Ps/2 port, all USB Ps/2 are not TRUE Ps/2 ports these are USB/Driver reliant. A True Ps/2 port is not!</p>
                        <p>Why are they taking it away? Read the Ps/2 section again.</p>
                        <p>From here on out everything is purely function and aesthetics. The more you chase aesthetics such as the MotherBoard which is beautiful - the higher the price will go.</p>  
                        <p>The cooling, fans, power supply, and case all have their functions and roles - but are quite generic and standardized from here on out.</p> 
                        <p>I will say Noctua(Cooling/Fans) and Corsair(Power Supply) you can never go wrong with.</p></section></div></div>
