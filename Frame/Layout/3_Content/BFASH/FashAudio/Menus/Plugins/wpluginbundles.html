                <h6>Rabbit Hole</h6>
                <h5 class="bh tc">In The World of Audio</h5></hgroup>

            <p>There are many Aspects to audio yet here will cover basics and resource what I personally use,
            what you will see repeatably throughout this blog and development,
            and provide basic options where applicable for those just starting out.</p>
            <p>These are just tools I use and hopefully help someone interested in Audio to get started or curious. My only true advice is to avoid subscriptions.</p> 
            <p>There is absolutely no reason to feel obligated to get obsessed with Plug-ins or a payment plan. Every DAW I have used by default is loaded with wonderful Plug-ins that cover damn near Everything you may ever need. See SetUp files at the top of this page for more info on Daws for options to avoid Subscription Plagues.</p>
            <p class="tc">Protools is no different.</p>
            <p class="tc">See the Audio Plug-in Guide In Docs just below for all the Protools Plug-ins.</p>

            <hgroup class="bible-content">
                <h5 class="bh">Default-Paid</h5></hgroup>

            <p>If Default Plug-ins are so Wonderful why use anything other or let alone pay for them?</p>
            <p>The thing with Audio Plug-ins is they are tools. Each brand has a version of that tool - some are better than others being R&amp;D and Modeled. Others simply re-imagine the concept, some are Dedicated to Purity, others on Character, some on Color.</p>
            <p>An example would be SSL and VC.</p>
            <p>These are the core of Music Fidelity. Yet, each sounds a bit different. Just as if you bought hardware and you compare your hardware with a friends with the same exact hardware. You would get 2 different sounds extremely subtle but different.<br>
            Over time those differences will grow - one will be kept in perfect condition - others will have gone through a much more vigorous life cycle creating all sorts of new hums, slight buzzes, weak knobs, calibrations, etc.</p>
            <p>In Audio those tiny little changes end up being MASSIVE differences where the beat up version adds a whole new flavor. Where 4 became 6, and 18db became 10. These little tweaks drastically change the equipments sound overall. Does it make it better than the other? Sometimes.</p>

            <hgroup class="bible-content">
                <h5 class="bh">Myth/Legends</h5></hgroup>

            <p>So when a Plug-in gets modeled, its source is Modeled from Particular Boards/HardWare.<br>
            Such as in Waves there is SSL Package with 2 versions(G Version and E Version) one has a brown knob one doesn't, in NI there is another version of the SSL which is more modeled after Factory SSL with the modeling and technology of way back when(Another big difference is Era), then recently updated to AAX for use in Protools, in my collection I also own the Official SSL version itself this is what comes in their consoles today - no surprise has the best SSL feel - to a degree ; but thats an entire different conversation. Not always better.<br>
            Essentially you are simply buying the same 3 plug-ins(Eq,Dynamic,Buss) multiple times each slightly different.</p>
            <p>Such as the V-Series are practically(varies) the same 3 compressors the 2A, 76, and 106. Each version of each one are wildly quite different.</p>
            <p>Does the sticky button really make things sound better or is it hype? Is there an all button pushed in hack creating mysteriously awesome sound or absolute rubbish? Can you really hear the sound, changes, differences between an API and SSL? Is this really the best because MJ or some superstar used this for your favorite album?</p>
            <p>Music is subjective - although all these can be tested to find out the answers and yes all can be verified True, but they are all also Myths - thats what makes them Legendary. Just because you get the equipment Marilyn Manson has and know all his tips, settings, etc - does not mean you will ever create, sound, or write anything Marilyn Manson does because you don't have him.</p>

            <hgroup class="bible-content">
                <h5 class="bh">Variations</h5></hgroup>

            <p>To paint a vivid image of what I am trying to say is if you own a Nintendo Switch, a Bike, or anything you know your gear ; the look, sounds, and feel, etc. Then you go to your friends house and he also has a Nintendo Switch, same Bike, or whatever but his Nintendo Switch is different the controller does not snap off - but his bike has pegs which yours does not, etc. etc.</p>
            <p>Same exact plug-ins, all different versions, all change capability's, look, and work-flow.</p>
            <p>All in All - The Pro is there are so many options from numerous brands(this creates other compad issues, financial, and system conflicts) and versions creating one endless rabbit hole to explore. The Con is it is a Rabbit Hole that will not make music or create anything at all.<br>
            Hence, everything I cover in Plug-ins is a very small sample of what is available even in just Waves alone(There are many fantastic Brands as their is a parallax universe of Plug-ins of a Universal Audio system that requires a financial commitment) - but the List Displayed on Site is an extremely powerful bundle of everything you will ever really need with endless possibilities.</p>

            <hgroup class="bible-content">
                <h5 class="bh">Plug-ins are not Hardware</h5></hgroup>

            <p>A Plug-in is an emulation and although very powerful and useful they are not Hardware. For evidence of the starch difference is price.</p>
            <p>The SSL Infinite Console(8-64 Single Channels) Plug-in for example can be purchased for $100(NI), $100(Waves), $500(SSL).<br>
            An actual SINGLE CHANNEL of a Console(8-64 Single Channels) of the hardware starts at $3,500(500 Series).</p>
            <p>For perspective the Console starts at around $25,000.</p>
            <p>Compare that to the price of the Plug-in which grants the entire Console of Infinite Channels for only $100-$500. Silly to think that an Unlimited SSL Console ; at half the cost of a Single channel SSLEQ(does not include dyn/buss) you will accomplish SSL quality.</p>
            <p>This does not include any of the Rooms, Compressors, or Gear.<br>
            Input of Audio is an entirely another aspect of Audio, a Plug-in is an invaluable tool none the less but it is not a replacement of Hardware.</p>
            <p>If you could and this was somehow possible there would be no need for Multi-Million dollar studios. Plug-ins simply can-not replace hardware. The world of Analogue is not bounded to 1 and 0 - is very different than Digital. This is not to take from the utility and amazing capabilities and awe of Plug-ins obviously I am a HUGE FAN. But, to put in perspective the reality of Audio innovation.</p>
            <p>Plug-ins are by themselves just equipment, tools, and instruments themselves.</p>
            <p>Some Plug-ins I mention will seem expensive as will transpire into Instruments - but in the big picture nothing displayed here is expensive when the Big Picture is considered.</p>
            <p>Another example is I feature 8 Pianos ranging From Grands, Baby Grands, to Uprights you know basic only a small price tag of $5k-$30k each x 8 - Yet, you can purchase, play, and OWN ALL these EXPENSIVE pianos for only $200. The power of and amazing respect to Sampling.</p>
            <p>Will they replace the Real thing... NO! Will they produce and make amazing baby grand cinematic breathtaking music... Yes! Will you be able to tell the difference? Depends.</p>
            <p>Important to keep in mind what you are truly getting in a Plug-in - High Quality Audio Creation Production Tools at an extremely low cost.</p>
            <p>Pretty sure that if you were to go crazy and buy ALL of Waves, NI, FabFiler, and for Good Measure SSL... it still be 25% the cost of just one of those Pianos, prob 1 of any original Hardware(Compressor) featured/modeled, and maybe working on your 3rd Channel Strip for your SSL Console.</p>
            <p>The power of Plug-ins as CLEAR AS DAY.</p>   

            <hgroup class="bible-content">
                <h5 class="bh">Plug-in Shine</h5></hgroup>

            <p>The sound, quality, and capabilities of Emulations/Plug-ins will all depend on the quality of Audio you Input, if you put in low quality audio, Plug-ins - nor Hardware will help you. The Chain of Import of Audio or the Quality of Audio sent to you is Crucial in the performance of Plug-ins/HardWare.</p>
            <p>This is the reason the SSL version of the SSL is not always better at 6x the cost of Waves/NI for it rolls the top and bottom in a curving beautifully way adding Body. The NI Version adds a Mid Warmth normally for tracks lacking Mid-Range I use alot on Transitions. As the Waves Version is neat as it adds a top and sort of thin/tinny element which shines on ridiculously compressed mp3 of most newbies to thin it out.</p>
            <p>All helpful but these Corrective aspects is not what these Plugins were designed to do.</p>
            <p>The better the source Input Audio the better ALL Plug-ins work. Same as with the Hardware. You would not use a $10 mic through a Plugin 3x that or a Vocal Chain worth say 500-1k dollars - thats like putting Syrup on a Potato and expecting a Lays Potato Chip. What you will get is a $10 mic Audio and a syrup covered Potato.</p> 
            <p>Every element of Audio gear is dependent on the next Element of Audio gear. Input Audio aka Recording(Studio) is to Capture High Quality Audio. If you are working with High Quality Audio then Plug-ins can be just as good as the Hardware as it moves towards the Mixing(Engineer) but if your source audio is Low Quality then Plug-ins/Hardware will not help you and normally rejected by the Mixer and sent back to the Recording Stage (Studio) to be redone/recaptured - nothing will help except to work on getting Higher Quality Audio.</p>

                <p>This topic creates many bottlenecks for cross collaboration.<br>Normally however these constraits are pushed aside due to most projects are files and not projects - in rare cases are collaborated projects (with plugins) done.</p>
                <p>Therefore this section will be most helpful to those just starting out and interested in audio and save them alot money on useless purchases.</p>
                <p>DAW plugins are fantastic as I use quite a few of them regurlary mainly the "Trim" - so there is no need to feel commited here.</p>
                <p>With that said Plugins you will see reguraly in NeinNein projects will be shown here.</p>

                <p>Although there are 44 Total Waves Plugins listed - if we exclude bundles there is really 32 Waves plugins I personally USE - for 12 plugins included within bundles(total) I dont really use and would replace them With the <a class="tc" href="https://www.waves.com/bundles/v-series#image" target="_blank">V-Series</a>, <a class="tc" href="https://www.waves.com/plugins/mondomod" target="_blank">MondoMod</a>, <a class="tc" href="https://www.waves.com/plugins/metaflanger" target="_blank">MetaFlange</a>, Enigma,
                and <a class="tc" href="https://www.waves.com/plugins/maxxbass#image" target="_blank">MaxxBass</a>.</p>
                <p>Quickly it becomes clear how big the World of Waves is.</p>

                <hgroup class="bible-content">
                    <h5 class="bh">Bundle Pro/Con</h5></hgroup>

                <p>Waves is by far one of the cheapest routes when Plugins are considered - but cheap is a nasty word when describing Waves Plug-ins. These are top notch, hands down, fantastic, world class Plug-ins Do Not let the Price fool you.</p>
                <p>After writing this it was pointed out to me I should have included the Silver Bundle instead of PowerPack. Which I felt obligated to address for future reasoning.</p>
                <p><a class="tc" href="https://www.waves.com/bundles/silver" target="_blank">Silver Bundle</a> will include MondoMod/MaxxBass - but not Metaflange or V-Series - something to keep in mind is that Silver will clash with Ren Bundle(if you decided to get the Ren Bundle) which is not a big deal at all - but the PowerPack avoids doubling Plugins and allows me to Display what you are actually getting.</p>
                <p>This will open up the Upgrade aspect which works wonderfully to avoid multiple license copies. Yet, not included in MY Single Plugins listed are:<br><a class="tc" href="https://www.waves.com/plugins/mondomod" target="_blank">MondoMod</a>, <a class="tc" href="https://www.waves.com/plugins/metaflanger" target="_blank">MetaFlange</a>, and <a class="tc" href="https://www.waves.com/plugins/maxxbass#image" target="_blank">MaxxBass</a>. For the same reason V-Series in Studio Classics </p>
                <p>Yet, all of these Wave bundles I display plus Waves single plug-ins can be replaced and acquired with(excluding H-Verb):<br><a class="tc" href="https://www.waves.com/bundles/horizon#image" target="_blank">Horizon</a> (extremely extra clunky but includes V Series) with twice as many plug-ins.<br> + <br>
                <a class="tc" href="https://www.waves.com/bundles/studio-classics-collection#image" target="_blank">Studio Classic Bundle</a>{Highly Recommended if you choose to purchase SSL or API} - includes SSL, API, and V-Series. Even in the case of API I actually note *just the Comp* at half the price of the Bundle. However, I understand that is my bias as I don't personally use the API EQ Plugins - but to not lead astray someone new I added the Bundle and not the single Plugin because for just a little more that may be their future GoTo and their secret sauce or preference. The API EQS are good and solid EQs.</p>

                <hgroup class="bible-content">
                    <h5 class="bh">World of UAD</h5></hgroup>

                <p>Important to note UAD is not mentioned at all. That is not due to UAD are not good plugins - but merely an eco system. The fact someone is reading this section is evidence one should not even concern themselves with UAD.</p>
                <p>Waves, Native Instruments, FabFilter, and SSL even if a veteran is more than most will ever need. UAD on the other hand starts at around $500 buy in before plugins. At that rate you could have purchased everything I recommend Waves or Fab Filter. Each plugin from UAD after that initial investment is starting at $150 each bringing total to $650 for 1 plugin. Is it worth it? Yes and no, better question how deep are your pockets? Will you be able to tell in final production? No, specially if you are using a 100 mic in a non treated room. Speaking of rooms most of the catalogue is not Native meaning you cant use them unless connected to the Hardware. So if you are mobile you wont be.</p>
                <p>All this to say this is why I do not have UAD has recommendations on site - yes they have great plugins but they come with allot of cons, and sadly more cons than pros which is a shame. Just as I never recommend subscription specially when there are plenty of other options available as all plugins I recommended will accomplish everything one would need and just about everything you will ever need. This is not a bashing of UAD - but for those not turning 6 figures and reality your money can be stretched much further.</p>
                <p>For example as I introduce the Waves Horizon and Waves Packages at near half the cost of just the UAD buy-in with 0 plugins.</p>

                <hgroup class="bible-content">
                    <h5 class="bh">Horizon Route + </h5></hgroup>

                <p>The Horizon Route would offer CLA Compressors(VC) as well as the V-Series-(Studio Classics) which are both solid products + Horizon itself has 83 plug-ins in total - thats Twice what I display here in every section combined at about exactly the same price - something to just keep in mind and deserved a mention.</p>
                <p>I also understand I am writing for a general audience - whom if they had such a budget on hand to toss wouldn't be reading this. Nor is BIG budget at all required other than just collecting collections - so my list helps break down what to consider based on their particular needs as Mondo, MetaFlange, and MassBass are the least of their worries in most cases - such as in cost SSL and the API Comp will shave $50 off budget - allowing options for something more essential, opening different routes, that contribute to their project with a reality budget with hands down the best Options already now in their toolbox.</p> 
                <p>Just as they do not need an arsenal of Compressors and Tools that they do not even know what they do with much of it not essential at all. So Once again I attempt to break it down to essentials and let them build from there which grants opportunity and not to overwhelm(with endless non-productive choices) but so that those starting out can learn what these tools are doing and not to get all worked up over budget.</p>
                
                <hgroup class="bible-content">
                    <h5 class="bh">Wave Discounts</h5></hgroup>

                <p>Waves has sales OFTEN so read them closely and customize this Custom Bundle below in ordering and you will be surprised you may just get half of all these plug-ins free. That $50 savings can be stretched tremendously.</p>
                <p>As each Bundle I have chosen displays an Upgrade Option which is friendly to those new - as well as keeps from plug-in repeats on Site.</p>
                <p>Not Included in Displayed on Site Single/Bundles is again <a class="tc" href="https://www.waves.com/bundles/studio-classics-collection#image" target="_blank">Studio Classic(V-Series) being the only loss</a>. Which is in both Horizon &amp; Studio Classics(double license). So If they choose to Upgrade from SSL or API - they can choose their Upgrade route and normally would not choose Studio Classics anyways not logically when EVERY other Option offers way more.</p>
                <p>Just as not included in any of the bundles - and are Single Plugins. Even with Horizon does not include DBX, DPR, Excite, and J-Tape which would remain as Single Plugins and add H-Verb again *as Noted* to the list where they would still need (H-Series Bundle).</p>
                <p>Going with PowerPack over Silver or Horizon is the logical choice for intended purposes - just as going SSL &amp; API over Studio Classics provides a more clear upgrade route.</p> 
                <p>As stated not included in the Single Plugins are <a class="tc" href="https://www.waves.com/plugins/mondomod" target="_blank">MondoMod</a>, Enigma, <a class="tc" href="https://www.waves.com/plugins/metaflanger" target="_blank">MetaFlange</a> <a class="tc" href="https://www.waves.com/plugins/maxxbass#image" target="_blank">MaxxBass</a> which need to be acquired separately - but only 3 are in included in Silver(with still excluding MetaFlange(Horizon) and doubling of half of Ren Bundle(Horizon).</p>
                
                <hgroup class="bible-content">
                    <h5 class="bh">Getting Started</h5></hgroup>

                <p>Horizon is the BEST Deal overall that is non debatable {Includes PowerPack, JJP, Ren, L2, Mondo, MetaFlange, Enigma, MaxxBass, 3Riders, and Much More} but if we go one step further<br> 
                + SSL + API + (DBX + DPR + Excite + J-Tape) + H-Verb = $581 with discounts(as of now) reduces to $459 with ()being Free. Granted this is where I would say to add in the <a class="tc" href="https://www.waves.com/bundles/manny-marroquin-signature-series" target="_blank">Manny Marroquin Sig Bundle</a> for an extra $60.</p>
                <p>But, thats not pocket change - however when you look at UAD being $500 buy in with 0 plugins - for the same price you have a full elite set of plugins.</p>

                <p>Horizon is great specially if you love to dabble, play, and explore tacking on the extras I mentioned takes it to a whole new level. Keep in mind that when it comes to Upgrade always remember you can upgrade at anytime and only pay the difference.</p> 
                <p>These are simply the Waves options to spare the endless choices. I am just trying to guide and navigate through the marketing and keep a constant reminder money does not make you sound better, does not make things easier(reality more choices more problems), as does not have to cost a fortune. As I stated at the beginning I only use 32 Waves plug-ins daily (and I own all of Waves) - thats not to say I don't use other Waves/Others plug-ins for I most certainly do - specially when dabbling and experimenting.</p> 
                <p>Essentially, could I do what I do without all the other plugins not listed here? Absolutely and I am sure everybody in Audio will say the same thing. In fact I Know for a fact they all agree. Plugins are tools, if your source is garbage - plugins no matter the cost will help you.</p>
                <p>Hopefully that clears up reasoning. With that out the way lets resource the plug-ins.</p>

            <p>NI is a world filled with amazing tools from delays, reverbs, etc available and as I said is a rabbit hole of tools.<br> 
            Yet, that is not the point of this blog as these are all stellar companies with stellar products.</p>
            <p>These are just plugins ; not instruments ; and tools unlike those listed under Native Insturments.</p>
            <p class="tc">When it comes to NI plugins these are the Stelliest of the Stellars.</p>

            <hgroup class="bible-content">
                <h5 class="bh">World of Native Plugins</h5></hgroup>

            <p class="tc">You can not go wrong with NI plugins they are all treasures.<br> The One that stands out the most here is the V-Series.<br>
            Unlike the V-Series in Waves which is still fantastic - I find NI V-Series is more resilient in most cases.<br> 
            The 2A is truely beautiful and my go to 2A.</p>
            <p class="tc">The SSL is always a shoot out and I find between Waves it is purely dependent on the project.</p>
            <p class="tc">The T-Series and I had a love hate relationship for along time. Eventually I would come to adore the V-Comp.<br>
            It has a certain magic I will be honest I have no way to describe it. Its just a gem.</p></div>

            <p>Keep in mind there is no 1 tool for any aspect - Audio is art - the proper tool for the job is the best tool for the project.</p>
            <p>If you want real rock type vocals this is not that tool, if you want crisp clarity such as celine dion these are not the plugins for that.<br>
            This is why there is such a variety of plugins and  reason for a toolbox ; due to each plugin has their own character, colors, tone, shape, and feel.</p>
            <p>So what is FabFilter good for? FabFilter plugs shine best in heavy effect music. The color it adds is musical in its own right. There is nothing at all transparent about FabFilter. With that said, Fab(Filter) in its own right shines being Fabulous Filter.</p>
            <p>Explained best in Hardware.</p></div>
