                <h6>Rabbit Hole</h6>
                <h5 class="bh tc">In The World of Audio</h5></hgroup>

            <p>There are many Aspects to audio yet here will cover basics and resource what I personally use,
            what you will see repeatably throughout this blog and development,
            and provide basic options where applicable for those just starting out or even possibly to those that dont really undersatand the difference between sound and hype.</p>
            <p>These are just tools I use and hopefully help someone interested in Audio to get started or curious. My only true advice is to avoid subscriptions.</p> 
            <p>There is absolutely no reason to feel obligated to get obsessed with Plug-ins or a payment plan. Every DAW I have used by default is loaded with wonderful Plug-ins that cover damn near Everything you will ever need. See SetUp files at the top of this page for more info on Daws for options to avoid Subscription Plagues.</p>
            <p class="tc">Protools is no different.</p>
            <p class="tc">See the Audio Plug-in Guide In Docs just below for all the Protools Plug-ins. Not really anything you cant accomplish with the standard defaults.</p>

            <hgroup class="bible-content">
                <h5 class="bh">Default-Paid</h5></hgroup>

            <p>If Default Plug-ins are so Wonderful why use anything other or let alone pay for them?</p>
            <p>The thing with Audio Plug-ins is they are tools. Each brand has a version of that tool - some are better than others being R&amp;D and "Modeled". Others simply re-imagine the concept, some are Dedicated to aesthetic Purity, others on Character, some on Color (this is normally default to bells and shelves).</p>
            <p>An example would be SSL and VC.</p>
            <p>These are the core of Music Fidelity. Yet, each sounds a bit different. Just as if you bought hardware and you compare your hardware with a friends with the same exact hardware. You would get 2 different sounds extremely subtle, but different.<br>
            Over time those differences will grow - one will be kept in perfect condition - others will have gone through a much more vigorous life cycle creating all sorts of new hums, slight buzzes, weak knobs, calibrations, etc.</p>
            <p>In Audio those tiny little changes end up being MASSIVE differences where the beat up version adds a whole "new flavor". Where 4 became 6, and 18db became 10. These little tweaks drastically change the equipments sound overall, due to the very way it is used and set is radically different to the exact same version. So the question is does it make it better than the other? No, Yes, Sometimes, Maybe, IDK.</p>

            <hgroup class="bible-content">
                <h5 class="bh">Subtle</h5></hgroup>

            <p>For instance, when a Plug-in gets modeled, its source is Modeled from Particular Boards/HardWare.<br>
            Such as in Waves there is SSL Package with 2 versions(G Version and E Version) one has a brown knob one doesn't.</p> 
            <p>I want to pause here because this is the best example. What is different between just the E &amp; G Series?</p>
            <p>We dont have to look far and wide between corporations, or even plugins to see this "HYPEs" tenticales. Here we have the same Corporation, with the Very Same Plugin, Modeling the Very same Board, with the only aesthetic blantant to notice is one is that modern sleek black background and one is Grey.</p>
            <p>Yet, the Bells and Shelves are radically different. The G Series - My perferred is much more Broad which is more musical in my opioion.</p>
            <p>The E series is much more narrow and "surgical" and albeit sounds way better with Rock. This means if you use the same exact settings on both they will sound different. On E-Series you will need to broaden the band, of the G you would need to narrow, even if you match them identically they still sound different.</p>
            <p>Now ask yourself which one is better? Thats the difference and yes they do sound ever so slightly different. E has more clarity &amp; presence, G has more harmonic &amp; body</p>
            <p>However, by default this alone will INFLUENCE what you are makeing.</p>
            <p>Subtle, but Audio is a ton of Subtle movements.</p>

            <p class="tc">Plug-ins comedown to more about MINDSET than they are Digital Tools, although are Digital Tools. This is Important to understand as we get into Technology.</p>

            <hgroup class="bible-content">
                <h5 class="bh">Endless Repetition</h5></hgroup>

            <p>Lets turn attention to NI(Native Instruments) where we find another version of the SSL which is more modeled after Factory SSL, not Not a particular producers, with the modeling and "technology" of way back when(Another big difference is Era, of modeling concepts themselves), then recently updated to AAX for use in Protools, in my collection I also own the Official SSL version itself this is what comes in their consoles today - no surprise has the "best" SSL feel but not the best "sound" imho - to a degree, although aestically is radically different ; but thats an entire different conversation. Not always better depending on your style, musical influences, etc.</p>
            <p>Essentially, we have now bought and spent $200 for the same 3 plug-ins sll-G, ssl E, ssl NI(Eq,Dynamic,Buss) each slightly different, but technically identical.</p>
            <p>Yet, excluding modeling, shelfs, curves, etc... the aethitics alone will influence your descions.</p>
            <p>This, will repeat again when we get to the V-Series which are practically(varies) yet again, the same 3 compressors of the 2A, 76, and 106. Each version of each one are wildly quite different as explained in the Original E &amp; G Series above.</p>

            <hgroup class="bible-content">
                <h5 class="bh">Myth/Legends</h5></hgroup>

            <p>Does the sticky button really make things sound better or is it hype? Is there an all button pushed in hack creating mysteriously awesome sound or absolute rubbish? Can you really hear the sound, changes, differences between an API and SSL? Is this really the best because MJ or some superstar used this for your favorite album?</p>
            <p>All True, All False. Music is subjective - although all these can be tested to find out the answers and yes all can be verified True, but they are all verified false being also Myths - thats what makes them Legendary. Just because you get the equipment Marilyn Manson has and know all his tips, settings, etc - does not mean you will ever create, sound, or write anything Marilyn Manson does because you don't have him.</p>
            <p>Plugins do not replace Talent, they are merely tools. Just because you have a Million Dollars in Gear doesnt mean you will produce anything good.</p>

            <p>Which brings us to the Analogue and Digital feud. Is Analogue better than Digital?</p>
            <p>Lets look at this objectively, rationally, and careful consideration of the facts of already put forward, and to come.</p>
            <p>Yes, in every way, shape, and form digital does not even compete with Analogue, Analogue is Far superior in every way, shape, and form. Because Digital is the best.</p> 

            <hgroup class="bible-content">
                <h5 class="bh">Variations</h5></hgroup>

            <p>To illustrate what I'm saying, if you possess a Nintendo Switch, a bicycle, or anything else, you're certainly familiar with your stuff; the look, sounds, and feel, among others. Then you join a friend of yours, whom also possesses a Nintendo Switch, a bike, or something identical, but his is different due to the fact his controller does not break off, and his bicycle has pegs compared to yours, besides many other characteristics.</p>
            <p>These are identical plug-ins, in several versions, with variation in functionality, appearance, and workflow.</p>
            <p>All in all, the pro is the reality that there are a plethora of possibilities available from numerous manufacturers (which can lead to financial difficulties, system conflicts, and other drawbacks) and versions, creating an endless exploratory rabbit hole. The negative aspect is that it's a rabbit hole that produces nothing whatsoever, not even music.<br>
            Due to there are many outstanding brands and also parallel universes of plug-ins from a Universal Audio System that requires a financial commitment because of technological reasons, everything I will cover in Plug-ins thus represents a very small sample of what is available even in just Waves Audio alone. </p>
            <p>However, the list displayed here on NineNeins provides an astonishingly, almost overkill, powerful bundle consisting of everything you will ever really need with endless possibilities.</p>

            <hgroup class="bible-content">
                <h5 class="bh">Plug-ins are not Hardware</h5></hgroup>

            <p>Plug-ins are an emulation and although very powerful and useful they are not Hardware. For evidence of the starch difference is price alone.</p>
            <p class="tc">Lets just look at 2 examples, 1 being My Favorite Waves Plugins and the other FabFilter.</p>

            <p>A simple side by side shows clear Price differences. Waves, with no competition is the sole winner when it comes to options, finances, possibilty, etc. The important part is to pay attention to the fact FabFilter offers 1 of every essential tool. Which is better? Completley up to you and your workflow.</p>
            <p>
            Compare either to a real life SINGLE CHANNEL of an SSL Console(range from 8-64 Single Channels) of the hardware starts at $3,500(500 Series).</p>
            <p>For perspective the Console starts at around $25,000.</p>
            <p>You do not need the whole console unless you are recording entire bands, or the like. So we instead will be realistic and Compare just a Single Analogue Channel($3,500 *500 Series* for EQ, DYN, and a Buss Comp for good measure), to the price of the Waves Plug-in Grey COMPLETE bundle($439). Which includes 4 EQ, 3 Strips, 6 Dyn, and 3 Buss Comp, that bundle contains an API Comp(2.5k-3.5k), Puigtech Eq, and a Fairchild(10k-35k).</p>
            <p>I lay it out in this format to really seperate the reality from fantasy. Not including a "76" or "2A" etc. It is absolutley silly to think that an Unlimited SSL Console alone ; at half the cost of a Single Channels SSLEQ(does not include dyn/buss/etc) you will accomplish SSL, Neve, API, etc quality.</p>
            <p>Not to mention any of the other Rooms, Compressors, or Gear.</p>
            <p>Then we look at the FabFilter. Which we can equate to a Digital Single Channel(Unlimited).</p>
            <p>Both Bundles COMBINED are still cheaper than a Single Analogue Channel(of modeled/emulated counterparts).</p>
            <p>Should make a Real Clear Big Picture of what we are talking about in perspective. Plugins even in the High end are cheap, the bigger question is how different are expensive plugins from cheap Plugins? The answer is...its near non-existent in an Audio Sense. Meanwhile, visually, useability, consistenancy, workflow, creature comforts...the differences are astounding.</p>
            <p>You are not going to get 65k-100k+ dollars of gear for $489. Now that we have cut through the Hype and marketing bs.</p>
            <p class="tc">Which is Better Waves of Fabfilter?</p>
            <p>Budget wise Waves wins, Quality wise... it depends. Neither is better than the other, workflow is different, gui is different, aethtics is different... but Audio wise there is 0 difference.</p>
            <p>The same can be said for Analogue, the entire concept and point of Ananlogue is to go "into the Box" with 80-95% edited and ready to Mix Audio. Doing most of the Big Editing outside, before you even reach for a Plugin.</p>
            <p>The Input of Audio is an entire different aspect of Audio, a Plug-in is an invaluable tool none the less but it is not a replacement of Hardware. Nor can it be, technologically speaking.</p>
            <p>The less sources you need the cheaper your Analogue setup will be.</p>
            <p>If you are recording bands, Drums is 5-8 channels alone, Guirtars 1 each, vocals. Where a Console starts makeing sense.</p>
            <p>If a Podcast you would need just a 1 Solid Vocal Chain + Guest, depending on Room you may even get away with just good mics, interface, and room, with Plugins.</p>
            <p>Analogue is simply a tool to get Clean Audio in. Plugins are just tools of Digital Audio, the cleaner the Audio the more stark a difference the Plugin will make.</p>

            <hgroup class="bible-content">
                <h5 class="bh">Plug-in Shine</h5></hgroup>

            <p>The sound, quality, and capabilities of Emulations/Plug-ins will all depend on the quality of Audio you Input, if you put in low quality audio, Plug-ins - nor Hardware will help you. The Chain of Import of Audio or the Quality of Audio sent to you - is Crucial in the performance of Plug-ins/HardWare.</p>
            <p>This is the reason the SSL version of the SSL is not always better at 6x the cost of Waves/NI for it rolls the top and bottom in a curving beautifully way adding Body. The NI Version adds a Mid Warmth normally for tracks lacking Mid-Range, nice when I use alot on Transitions. As the Waves Version is neat as it adds a top and sort of thin/tinny element which shines on ridiculously compressed mp3 of most newbies who tend to destroy.</p>
            <p>All helpful but these Corrective aspects is not what these Plugins were designed to do, therefore their ins a natural character by simply loading them.</p>
            <p>There is a fair argument that EQ is just EQ, which is not essentially true. If none of these work I will turn to FabFilters Q3, it is crucial to understand once you enter this realm of depth the audio quality simply sucks. Drawing in an EQ is great to have on hand if you are being Creative in soundscaping, or room eliminating corrective eq(avoid 95% of this with Analogue), not for mixing songs.</p>
            <p>What makes Analogue so great is the pre-selected best freq/range gives limited options, An audio Source should sound good going through any plugin, what you are looking for is computer useage, and listening how it grabs, releases, and best handles transients. Some plugs will sound better on a source than others, with limited options you can shoot them out. Simple oversampleing will provide radical difference in a-b, if you exhaust options, try something else. IMHO, once you get surgical with it, your mindset is nolonger in the song, your a-b option is eliminated, and you begin mixing with your eyes... huge mistake.</p> 
            <p>The better the source Input Audio the better ALL Plug-ins work. Same as with the Hardware. You would not use a $10 mic through a Plugin 3x that or a Vocal Chain worth say 500-1k dollars - thats like putting Syrup on a Potato and expecting a Lays Potato Chip. What you will get is a $10 mic Audio and a syrup covered Potato.</p>
            <p>You dont put a drunk Karokee singer behind a multi-thousand dollar mic going into multi-thousands of dollars worth of Analogue gear and expect to make Good Music. Unless maybe you are Nirvana.</p>  
            <p>Every element of Audio gear is dependent on the next Element of Audio gear. Input Audio aka Recording(Studio) is to Capture High Quality Audio. If you are working with High Quality Audio then Plug-ins are just as good as the Hardware as it moves towards the Mixing(Engineer), but if your source audio is Low Quality then Plug-ins/Hardware will help you and normally rejected by the Mixer and sent back to the Recording Stage (Studio) to be redone/recaptured - nothing will help except to work on getting Higher Quality Audio.</p>
            <p>Analogue is not just boxes of EQ and Comp. It is the entire Process. Starting with Room, Mic, Eq, Comp, Audio Interface, to Computer. All these Outside factors matter, this is what Analogue entails. Notice I just described a Recording Studio. What you dont want is being filtered, and dynamically controlled all before it enters your computer.</p>
            <p>This means it sounds Fantasic already before you even load a single Plugin.</p>
            <p>In Mixing the same thing takes place as Plugins Technoligically speaking fall short for a very practical reason. Data.</p>

            <hgroup class="bible-content">
                <h5 class="bh">Technologically Speaking</h5></hgroup>

            <p>Technology only mimicks reality and without getting into the technical details. Plugins are merely an illusion, they can be used to create an illusion that is not perceiveable by the Masses as get away with this further deception due to the playback devices of how it is consumed in the lowest possible, barely functional devices they have mainstreamed such as phones. A complete de-evolution. Sound has not gotten better it has become unimagineably worse from both reality, sonically, and technologically "plugin" perspectives.</p>
            <p>For those new to the Audio World, Plugins are wonderful to teach the very basics as well as introduce concepts, gear, in amazing working interactive learning graphs of operation if you will. Which do have the capabilty of doing audio production, task, and moves. But, at the end of the day it is simply code and fisher-price at best. And, I know it seems like I am bashing Plugins, I assure you I am not, if you are not doing Recording, then Plugins are PHENOMENAL. I just hate seeing some being told just record vocals into this and put this 10 plugin chain on it, magic.</p>
            <p>Thats a lie and you are being duped.</p>
            <p>Industry Standard, professional, or whatever word you want to use for it, is the real deal they have turned into a marketing ploy.</p>
            <p>Why bother selling a record for $15, when you can sale Subscriptions by default of that same record over and over for $15 a month. Why bother going to a "Real Studio" full of Analogue Gear if plug-ins are all you need?</p>
            <p>Why is it the quality and state of music at this period in time, pure garbage?</p>
            <P>Finally, why is it if you do get signed, the first step the label does is getting you to a "Sound Studio" with all the Millions of dollars in Gear - that you "dont need" the very first thing a "Studio Artist" experiences.</P>  
            <p>Surely, you could just use plug-ins... why is it Sony and all the big names have these Big Analogue Consoles?</p>
            <p>Better question for a Sony Comparision: if Plugins are so good why would Sony give you a plug-in emulation of their c-series microphone for, Idk $100. But, the real one is 10k dollars. Do you really think that plugin-in is even in the same league? No, its a marketing ploy, a hype to make money, simply an over complicated cheap plugin that copies over eq curves you could easily dial in yourself with FabFilter Q3.</p>
            <p>Are these not the same people and corporations that just said, get that sound we provide for only $40?</p>
            <p>If plugins as the hype says are "the real deal", "unnoticeable in sound", "undistinguishable"... wouldnt these Corporations find it to be Cost Effective to ditch the Multi-Million Dollar studios in exchange for the real deal plugins? Makeing Millions more in profits? Surely, we all know Corporations are the first to make budget cutting descions... yet the gear remains, maintenace, jobs, an entire Analogue world remains.</p>
            <p>Thriving, not by hobbiest, not by arrogance, or anything of the sort. But, merely because nothing Digital is even close to Analogue in the Audio Recording World. The technolgy does not exist to replace it, the technology ALREADY exist... it is called Analogue. As having already treated Audio going into the Box, the starting point is already 80% of the finished product.</p>
            <p>This is where Plugins take over, where Analogue will sort of become a diminishing return factor pushing back out of the box back into Analogue.</p>

            <hgroup class="bible-content">
                <h5 class="bh">In the Box or in the Boxes</h5></hgroup>

            <p>All in all the Analogue Boxes exist because they hold the required equipment to makeing Beautiful Music.<br> They are designed to do just that.</p>
            <p>Think of Analogue equipment identical to how you look at a DSP server, or a Graphic Card, or minature dedicated servers. That is essentially what they are.</p>
            <p>In the Box has none of those things, if you were to make a Custom Audio Computer, no different than a Gameing, Photo, etc... you will get a "Graphic Card" which you guessed it is Analogue Equipment.</p> 
            <p>UA or any DSP alternative is simply Analogue equipment... without the amount of processing it would require to Mimick just one Analogue Box is astronomically impossible, even these expensive DSP servers are super limited. It can not be done, it is the very reason Analogue equipment exist to begin with. It is the very reason buying a Graphic Card is a REQUIREMENT. It can not be done "in the box". Again, the Price of Analogue Equipment is in tune with the price of a Graphic Card. The more Resource heavy, the bigger the card or multiple you need. Only Audio Gear is task specific (eq, comp, etc).</p>
            <p>Is it not hillarious as technology of plug-ins and their Graphical UIs have reached the point they have you also need a Graphic Card, aka Analogue Equipment just to use "in the box". Again, De-Evolution before your eyes.</p>
            <p>Things to consider, for the normal person is a plugin simply makes digital editing possible, it can influence projects and their direction, it also can create good illusions of the Audio going in(Analogue) even through simply the Audio Interface, overall this is digital marketing and hype, as contradictory as that may sound. As budget is the overall, practical, and reasonable POWER of plugins.</p>
            <p>Nothing more; nothing less.</p>
            <p>Outside of the digital realm, plug-ins become a giant ponzi scheme, a multi-facted rabbit hole grifting ponzi-scheme. If you really want that sound or WORKFLOW you are desperately seeking, go get it, instead of paying endlessly for subscriptions and bs hype that will never... and is incapable of ever giving you want you are seeking. If the Audio is Outside the Box.</p>
            <p>Analogue makes it so what goes "into the Box" what you want to begin with. Once the Audio passes through Analogue the sound should be almost exactly what you wanted. Now you can do mixing, or else you spend all your time cleaning and editing which is not mixing.</p>
            <p>As I said, financial are a reasonable and practical sense of rationalizing. So take your $40 subscription to the 4 plugin developers each, and the 20-99 dollar subscription to daw subscription or whatever ponzi-scheme subscription or update plan, and use that $3200 a year, to instead get the Analogue setup of your dreams - that will give and guarantee what you are looking for. I promise you will never find it in plug-ins, or subscription, or updates <span class="bold">If Recording</span>. That is simply a revenue stream for those that Own and Use Analogue gear for everything they do.</p>
            <p>If you are sampeling or the like then Plugins Shine, your samples are Professionally Recorded when brought into the Box.</p>
            <p>The SECRET is getting the Audio into the BOX".</p>
            <p>Isnt it odd how nothing new or better seems to bypass Analogue of old. Yet, yet daily you need this, you need that, must update, must enter credit card, must sign up, must pay for this, so that it works with that, requires subscription, for this subscription, to update, that updates, update.</p>
            <p>Yet, The Waves plugins of today, are the very same plugins of the 90s, multiplied by dev teams doing the same exact thing.</p> 
            <p>For a final, sort of not Audio speaking, but identical. Name one thing I can not do on Windows 7 that I can do on anything after. The answer is nothing.</p>
            <p>In Audio, the answer is nothing, I use Protools 11, I use Version 11 Waves, I have all the AAX technology, the only difference is I save a fortune, and I dont rebuy my plugins over and over every year (currently on 14 with a flat rate of $250), essentially that is 1k dollars I have saved and not pissed away for things I already own. Not including I dont buy Protools over and over. Etc.</p>
            <p>In a sense my DAW and Plugins are as Analogue as Digital is capable of being, or ever going to be.</p>
            <p>With those savings on Waves(Alone) and Protools(Alone), the WarmAudio Gear is more than afforable. Add in all the other nonsense subscriptions going outside Audio and that 500 Series Input Chain WILL in fact give me that REAL SSL sound, going through a REAL Neve Preamp, with a Real API compressor, and Mics to compliment.</p>
            <p>If Money is power, break the chains of subscribeing to endless subscription based ponzi schemes and nonsense that will never get that sound you are chaseing. The reality is, dude, you will never be a woman.</p>  
            <p>Proven, historically, financially, scientifically, sonically, technologically, logically, practicality, reasonably, audibly, visually, and mere reality.</p>
            <p>Once you have Amazing quality audio going in, then Plugins become the Gift that make anything possible. They are truley powerful, shine in glory, and you can hear the Magic of Plugins.</p>
            <p>ONCE you get the Audio "In the Box" using Analogue.</p>
            <p>If building this setup is not in your interest this is what Recording Studios are for.<br>
            To bring High Quality clean Audio into the Box. Now your investment in Plugins is night and day.</p>

                <h5 class="bh">Waves Audio</h5></hgroup>

                <p>This topic creates many bottlenecks for cross collaboration.<br>Normally however these constraits are pushed aside due to most projects are files and not projects - in rare cases are collaborated projects (with plugins) done.</p>
                <p>Therefore this section will be most helpful to those just starting out and interested in audio and save them alot money on useless purchases.</p>
                <p>DAW plugins are fantastic as I use quite a few of them regurlary mainly the "Trim" - so there is no need to feel commited here.</p>
                <p>With that said Plugins you will see reguraly in NeinNein projects will be shown here.</p>

                <hgroup class="bible-content">
                    <h5 class="bh">World of Waves</h5></hgroup>

                <p>Although there are 44 Total "Waves Plugins" listed - if we exclude Bundles there is really 38 Waves plugins I personally USE. See "Docs" for Grey Waves Power Pack.

                <hgroup class="bible-content">
                    <h5 class="bh">Bundle Pro/Con</h5></hgroup>

                <p>Waves is by far one of the cheapest routes when Plugins are considered - but cheap is a nasty word when describing Waves Plug-ins. These are top notch, hands down, fantastic, world class Plug-ins Do Not let the Price fool you.</p>

                <p>Pay attention to sales sometimes its cheaper to get Bundle, other times its cheaper to buy Seperate. Waves plugins overall avg to around $15 each. Bringing "Grey Waves Power Pack" to about $570.</p>+

                <hgroup class="bible-content">
                    <h5 class="bh">World of UAD</h5></hgroup>

                <p>Important to note UAD is not mentioned at all. That is not due to UAD are not good plugins - but merely an eco system. The fact someone is reading this section is evidence one should not even concern themselves with UAD.</p>
                <p>Waves, Native Instruments, Audio Obsession, and FabFilter even if a veteran is more than most will ever need. UAD on the other hand starts at around $500 buy in before plugins. At that rate you could have purchased everything I recommend Waves or Fab Filter. Each plugin from UAD after that initial investment is starting at $150 each bringing total to $650 for 1 plugin. Is it worth it? Yes and no, better question how deep are your pockets?</p> 
                <p> UAD is essentially just a workflow, much like Slate. Will you be able to tell in final production? No, specially if you are using a 100 mic in a non treated room. Speaking of rooms most of the catalogue is not Native meaning you cant use them unless connected to the Hardware. So if you are mobile you wont be.</p>
                <p>All this to say this is why I do not have UAD as a recommendation on site - yes they have great plugins but they come with allot of cons, and sadly more cons than pros which is a shame. Just as I never recommend subscription(Slate) considering there are plenty of other options available as all plugins I recommended will accomplish everything one would ever need and just about everything you will ever need. This is not a bashing of UAD - but for those not turning 6 figures and the reality your money can be stretched much further.</p>
                <p>For example as I introduce the Waves Horizon and Waves Packages at near half the cost of just the UAD buy-in with 0 plugins. Analogue Obsession ONE of a kind plugins, and Fab Filters and NIS amazing additions for the Toolbox.</p>

                <hgroup class="bible-content">
                    <h5 class="bh">Horizon Route + </h5></hgroup>

                <p>The Waves Horizon Route would offer CLA Compressors(VC) as well as the V-Series-(Studio Classics) which are both solid products + Horizon itself has 83 plug-ins in total - thats Twice what I display here in every section combined at about exactly the same price - something to just keep in mind and deserved a mention. Sometimes bulk is way cheaper, if you wanted all those extra plugins, alot of fun ones in there.</p>
                <p>I also understand I am writing for a general audience - whom if they had such a budget on hand to toss wouldn't be reading this. Nor is BIG budget at all required other than just collecting collections - so my list helps break down what to consider based on their particular needs as Mondo, MetaFlange, and MassBass are the least of their worries in most cases - such as in cost SSL and the API Comp will shave $50 off budget - allowing options for something more essential, opening different routes, that contribute to their project with a reality budget with hands down the best Options already now in their toolbox.</p> 
                <p>Just as one does not need an arsenal of Compressors and Tools that they do not even know what they do with much of it not essential at all, gimmicky, useless, and or just collectiable.</p> 
                <p>So Once again I attempt to break it down to essentials and let them build from there which grants opportunity and not to overwhelm(with endless non-productive choices) but so that those starting out can learn what these tools are doing and not to get all worked up over budget.</p>

                    <br> This is a rabbit hole topic. NI (Native Instruments) also has wonderful plugins such as an SSL which is one my alt option to Waves SSL(Analog Obsession Buss too), a VC I personally like more than Waves, and Tubes I use very Often. This will not include reverbs and delays that are phenomenal.</p>

            <p>NI is a world filled with amazing tools from delays, reverbs, etc available and as I said is a rabbit hole of tools.<br> 
            Yet, that is not the point of this blog as these are all stellar companies with stellar products.</p>
            <p>These are just plugins ; not instruments ; and tools unlike those listed under Native Insturments.</p>
            <p class="tc">When it comes to NI plugins these are the Stelliest of the Stellars.</p>

            <hgroup class="bible-content">
                <h5 class="bh">World of Native Plugins</h5></hgroup>

            <p class="tc">You can not go wrong with NI plugins they are all treasures.<br> The One that stands out the most here is the V-Series.<br>
            Unlike the V-Series in Waves which is still fantastic - I find NI V-Series is more resilient in most cases.<br> 
            The 2A is truely beautiful and one of my go to 2As(Anlouge Obsessions is my Default).</p>
            <p class="tc">The SSL is always a shoot out and I find between Waves it is purely dependent on the project. When it comes to the Buss again Analogue Obsession is  frequently the winner of that shootout. </p>
            <p class="tc">The T-Series and I had a love hate relationship for along time. Eventually I would come to adore the V-Comp in this set.<br>
            It has a certain magic I will be honest I have no way to describe it. It is just a gem.</p></div>

            <p>Melda is much like Univeral Audio(UAD) and Waves Audio when it comes to all encompassing workflow and/or bundles. They offer literally everything.</p>
            <p>Unlike hardware reliant UAD which is a buy in system workflow and unlike Waves which dominated the marketing side of things, Melda is much more obscured and reserved.</p>
            <p>Will focus on what really makes Melda Standout such as no Subscription Update Plan like Waves has<br>
            as well as in many cases much more indepth control than others, No hardware dependence as UAD has, with no Subscription to use like Slate has.</p>
            <p>Meldas Subscription is a payment program, Subscribe to Own. Like I said innovations you dont see anywhere else.</p> 
            <p>Featured like Analogue Obsession these are free introductory to the Melda Workflow.<br> 
            As well with simply one example of of the power of supporting.</p>
            <p>The 2 FREE plugins are a demonstration of how Melda stands out innovationally; where functions that have not even been referenced to this point come into play.</p>
            <p>1 plugin is not free, but unlike Inphase of Waves(alt for manual technical); Meldas Inphase version in Automatic although may not work in all instances or complex projects, Meldas will however, knockout everyday Drums and reoccuring nuiances.</p>
            <p>A fantastic example of again of the same tool as Waves, but entirely different useage and purposes.</p>

            <p>Keep in mind there is no 1 tool for any aspect - Audio is art - the proper tool for the job is the best tool for the project.</p>
            <p>Which Brings us to FabFilter.<br>
            These simple basic but beautiful functionality variety of plugins are simply more of a workflow to the toolbox.<br></p>
            <p>So what is FabFilter good for? FabFilter plugs shine best in simple clean GUI and like all the plugs that came before it are fantasitic utilitys. Q3 always stands out more than the rest due its its gorgeous UI and direct workflow.</p>
            <p>Like Waves Basic without the Beauty of UI, or the Waves Ren Bundle which introduce offers the same thing with a UI package and a few more utilitys, FabFilters UI is unlike so many provideing the same utility you expect with slight varitons of grabby and variable sound.</p>
