                    <h5 class="bh tc">The World of Audio</h5></hgroup>

                <p>Most documentation for particular applications is pretty straight forward - all thats really left is learning the language.<br> As long as you know what you seek to achieve, the limits of your vision, and familiar with the pattern of language - Audio becomes a breeze.</p>
                <p>This section is just the absolute basics -  of learning the language.<br> The language here is mostly just file types/extensions.</p>
                <p>Therefore think of the "Audio" language as a set of functions. No different than the language you speak.<br> Such as "Editing"(shaping), "Mixing"(blending), and "Mastering"(polishing) for example - this takes in consideration the process and objective.<br> This will create your "Type"(.ext) of "Extension"(software) as well as "Focus"(aim).</p>
                <p>Such as if you are Displaying or Showcasing Audio you will want the absolute Best Quality(.WAV/Similar)-Original(Resolution/BitRate). Meanwhile, this will also become very data heavy specially playing those WAV files simultaneously without a computer powerful enough to process - therefore the reduction in data or File Changes to MP3 become more Optimal depending on CPU power.<br>Its all just purpose.</p>
                <p>The language will determine when to switch between Types and why you should also - as well as when you don't have to.<br> Lets focus on just the Main types.</p>
                <p>The combination of these extensions creates the language - the combination of languages displays each Audio Sample at its optimal resolution.</p>

                <p>The only real Pro/Con here is WAV/MP3 ; yet, it is really not even a Pro/Con but merely purpose. With that said :</p>
                <p>WAV<wbr> is far Superior in Quality<wbr> however Inferior in Size.<wbr>
                <br>MP3<wbr> is far Superior in Size<wbr> however can(sort of depending on project) be Equivalent in Quality.<wbr>
                <br>OGG<wbr> varies<wbr> and more for development situations.<wbr></p>
                <p>As Options here are just standard.</p>
                <p>Midi<wbr> is Input<wbr> Project Composition.<wbr>
                <br>MP4<wbr> is used more for Video Projects<wbr> for slightly higher quality audio.<wbr>
                <br>P-Type<wbr> varies<wbr> On your Audio Player.<wbr></p>

                <hgroup class="bible-content">
                    <h5 class="bh">WAV/MP3 Differences</h5></hgroup>

                <p>WAV dominates in Showcase/Release such as Recording/Listening - however with captured frequency comes great filesize.<wbr> This is not really a problem until rendering, transferring, uploading, downloading, and Mixing. Where the problem caused is by the data of BitRates.</P>
                <p>Sure one could compress the WAV to make it smaller - but compression has already reduced the BitRate - therefore taken utility out of WAV.<wbr> Enter MP3<wbr> which is way more versatile.<wbr> MP3 is the standard default for this very reason, which also gives the option to listen, stream, download on the fly on nearly any device. Although the compromise is normally highly compressed which practically rules out editing and mixing.</p>
                <p>All in all WAV should only be used for Recording/Personal Collections/Originals/Production/Showcase.<br>
                MP3 on the other hand is for quite everything else except Recording, Editing, or Mixing : which is not exactly true but generally accurate.</p>
                <p>Where does this leave OGG?<br>
                OGG is a container <wbr> which provides quite higher quality audio and not as crushed as MP3 in NineNeins Development.<br>
                You could use OGG for even further compression - not advised<wbr> for such little benefit as I recommend to just convert to MP3.</p>

                <p>Therefore think of "Audio Plugin" language as a set of functions. No different than the language you speak.</p>
                <p>Such as "EQ"(shaping), "Compression"(styleing), and "SFX"(effect) for example - this takes in consideration the process and objective.<br> This alone will create your "Type" of "Plugin" to use as well as "Focus".</p>
                <p>Such as if you are Recording Audio you do not want background noise, echoes, and other sounds inside the Recording.<br>You want to aim for the most pristine sounding Audio you can get. So the Focus here will be mostly a compressor(light limiter). Although varies on Sound Booth and project.</p>
                <p>If you are Mixing Audio you do want to create and add in background noise reflections, echoes, and other sounds With the Recording such as EQ and SFX.</p>
                <p>The language will determine when to switch between Types and why you should do so also - as well as when you don't have to.<br> 
                Lets focus on just the Main types.</p>

                    <h5 class="bh">Compound Grammar</h5></hgroup>

                <p>If we Combine EQ/Correction<wbr> we are simply defining the Noun.</p>
                <p>If we combine either of these with a Compressor, we enter into add-jectives.</p>
                <p>In the first chart I mentioned R/D was a noun of Why/How.<br>
                In the second Chart I separated Re-Verb and Delay and said they were Verbs.</p>
                <P>This is one of the most misunderstood aspects of Audio therefore by properly understanding that a Compressor is an Ad-jective we will begin to quickly see how Re-Verb(in the name) &amp; De-lay(action) are both Nouns/Verbs/Adjective creating a Saturation(AdVerb).</P>
                <p>To Understand this we must look a the Compressor Grammar.</p>
                
                <hgroup class="bible-content">
                    <h5 class="bh">Compressor Grammar</h5></hgroup>

                <p>The compressor is by far the most asked about and misunderstood of all audio equipment - the compressor is also called a Limiter, De-esser, Gate, Expander, Exciter, Multi-Band, and one can even say a Tape Machine.</p>
                <p>In short a compressor is "Everything" relabeled, renamed, and tune designed - to do certain aspects of compression without crushing the Audio.<br> Look at compressors as custom task built swiss army knife. a Compressor is simple Control of the Dynamics.</p>
                <p>Such for example a "Limiter" is simply a term of TYPE of Compression, a Limiter is simply a Strong Compression.</p>  
                <p>Another example we see with the Deesser which is a Combined Eq(Correction)/Compression into 1 making it possible to hone in(EQ) and activate the compressor to compress only certain frequencies.</p>
                <p>A Gate/Expander is the Combination of Correction/Compressor to turn off and on the Audio - by Sound level(Volume).<br> In which if volume does not reach a certain threshold(level) the Audio will not come thru - or if the Audio reachs a certain Threshold(volume) the audio is Compressed back down to set level. Allowing one to control the Sound that may pass through and when audio must be reducrd back down keeping a constant level Recording.<br> Which helps to block out back ground noise.</p> 
                <p>Notice the Compressor is the main tool here - each aspect is an Adjective describing the Nouns shape, volume, frequency, etc. Hence here we create Vocal Chains and separate the task of the Compressor, with other task to handle specific designed compressors that can lightly touch and effect the audio, before moving on to the next Compressor/Device in the chain.</p>
                <p>Example : say we want to remove the 2.5k fequency - you could use an EQ but that would be a permanent change. Instead, we can use a Gate to control Threshold, depending on the source you may just want to tap that 2.5k down 2 db at a certain threshold automatically - enter band Compression. We will take that very signal and once the audio passes through that "band Compression" we will can then add another "compressor" after for a "blanket compression" that compensates for the 2.5k level drop in a single constant waveform.</p>
                <p>If more drastic EQ needs to be done we can grab and add an EQ to this chain between whereever needed for sculpting - if not then using these 3 compressors works better for situations such as live and podcast.</p>
                <p>This creates the difference of a Strip(Channel). Normally that flows EQ, Dyn(Dynamics-Compression/Gate), Buss(Compression).<br>    
                Which grants option of Parallax-Compression. which is outside the scope here.</p> 
                <p>Notice how all this is adjective, that is exactly what the Compressor is doing.</p>

                    <h5 class="bh">Re-Verb Delay</h5></hgroup>
               
                <p>Which brings us to the Action of the Noun, whether that be Delays and or Re-Verb.<br>
                The Delay(Space) and Reverb(Motion) but still make maintains the Why &amp; How of the Noun.</p>
                <p>ReVerb will always go by topic and location of the Noun, if it raining in the Project(song, film, etc.) the ReVerb will reflect(Why) this.<br>
                The Delay will express the emotion(How) - creating Time and Space(Noun) in action(Verb) the audio creates the audible Saturation(AdVerb) description of the Noun.</p>
