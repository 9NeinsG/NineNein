            <p>You may look at this Theory as nonsense, stupid, pathetic, or a waste of time. However, that does not change what is presented here. There are tons of materials if I had interest in nonsense, stupid, pathetic, and just wanted to waste time. Yet, I am no fan of nonsense, stupid, pathetic, or wasting time.</p>
            <p>This is what inspired me to sit down and actully bring this presentation to life.</p>
            <p>If I wanted to waste time I would cover Harry Potter, or StarWars, or Tolkien, Matrix and plenty of other stories - the problem here is these are not stories of Christianity. Many will point to references, symbolism, or parts, or lines, or even scenery, title, characters, ect. Yet, at the end of the day they are pulling at nothing trying to create a narrative that is not there.</p>
            <p>Who is behind it - and Why does it exist - will destroy 100% of all claims if you use these sources mentioned above. There is no Christianity in them, plenty of blasphemy but zilch of Christianity.

            <p>Every Story has an influence and no doubt Christianity is pulled from all the time - that does not make a work Christian - it does not make it True - it does not suddenly represent Christianity - and if that is what someone is trying to do - you are but wasteing your time. As I stated I am no fan of that concept.</p>
            <p>Every story has a central influence, narrative, message, and recreation. This is critical to understand and acknowledge. Nothing comes and/or is created out of nothing and from nowhere.</p>

            <p>Zelda is no different when it come to these facts, it is the greatest representation of Christianity ever done it is the Central narrative. This is not a waste of time to bring to light - but a disection of one of the greatest masterpiece works of absolute art.</p> 
            <p>With every step of the way through Links NatSoc Theory you will learn so much - you will walk through the Bible with every step, explore History at every turn, and play one of the Greatest Games and Hear the story that requires no console, purchase, or controller in vivid imaginative detail - to solve the greatest Puzzle that took a Lifetime to create.</p>
            <p>Thats not a sales pitch for I have nothing at all to gain from putting Link NatSoc Theory together. Do not mistake me and assuming I am advocating Zelda as a substitute for the Bible - it is not. Quite the contrary, Zelda is a representative story of the Bible.</p>
            <p>I only invite you to come on an adventure with me.</p>
