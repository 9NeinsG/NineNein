                <p>The Mask Story starts once Link is transformed into a Deku.</p> 
                <p>This is symbolizes "Gods Promises in particular the Birth of Isaac" in Genesis 18.</p>

                <p>If you do not know : the Body of the DekuChild granting us the Mask was the "Deku Butlers Son" who was murdered by Majora.</p>
                <p>This is the symbolic representation of the Sacrifice of Issac in Genesis 22, for Link now holds the promise of the Birth of Issac, which just to fill in for those unfamiliar "The Deku Butler(Servant)" the father(Abraham) of the "the sacrificed son(Issac)" all gos back to the Great Deku Tree(Abraham) we will first encounter in Ocarina of Time.</p>
                <p>This is where we get the first glimpse of the Time connection - which if you read SkyWard Sword at the beginning is the Great Tree.</p>

                <p>Next up on the list is Ishmaels Birth.<br> Which takes place when we learn the "Gorons Lullaby" this is Baby Ishmale and if you have read the [Sypnosis] and [Shield] about the Islamic Crest, Soundtrack, the Color Red, and [Race] and [Religion] History, and Location inwhich many tell you was all a "Zelda Mistake" then why are they doubleing tripeling here, since they doubled down previously from Skyward-PhantomHourGlass?</p>

                <p>As we glide directly into the Famine of Canaan</p> 
                <p>Which is also featured with the Gorons being to cold to gather food when it should be Spring. Here also enters the Zoras who can not not fish because the Waters are odd and very murky to where they can not see.</p>

                <p>The Gerudos complain about the same thing, and so does a Fisherman lusting for a Picture of a Gerudo. This is no accident this is perfect Biblical account as we will come to see.</p>

                <p>As finally we come to The Tower of Babel in the heart of Ikana(Canaan) called Stone Tower - decked out with Baphomet/Moloch imagery with a idol of Majora inside which houses twin cities Sodom and Gomorrah.</p> 

                <p>That is 4 for 4</p>
                <p>Deku(Issac), Goron(Ishmael), Zora(Famine), Link.</p>

                <p>It may also be important to note here the Deku is of no help in Stone Tower Temple being far to light to do anything - for Issac has not yet been born. Which will tie us directly into "A Link Between Worlds" and "TriForce Heros(Green[Link], Blue[Zora], Red[Goron])"</p> 

                <p>What is the evidence of this?</p>
                <p>This breakdown should have already answered that. But, to answer this question we must understand the Story itself. Lets walk through Majoras Mask and in great detail that will be undeniable. This I guarantee.</p>
