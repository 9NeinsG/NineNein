                <p>The Mask Story starts once Link is transformed into a Deku.</p> 
                <p>This is symbolizes "Gods Promises in particular the Birth of Isaac" in Genesis 18.</p>

                <p>If you do not know : the Body of the DekuChild granting us the Mask was the "Deku Butlers Son" who was murdered by Majora.</p>
                <p>This is the symbolic representation of the Sacrifice of Issac in Genesis 22, for Link now holds the promise of the Birth of Issac, which just to fill in for those unfamiliar "The Deku Butler(Servant)" the father(Abraham) of the "the sacrificed son(Issac)" all gos back to the Great Deku Tree(Abraham) we will first encounter in Ocarina of Time.</p>
                <p>This is where we get the first glimpse of the Time connection - which if you read SkyWard Sword at the beginning is the Great Tree.</p>

                <p>Next up on the list is Ishmaels Birth.<br> Which takes place when we learn the "Gorons Lullaby" this is Baby Ishmale and if you have read the [Sypnosis] and [Shield] about the Islamic Crest, Soundtrack, the Color Red, and [Race] and [Religion] History, and Location inwhich many tell you was all a "Zelda Mistake" then why are they doubleing tripeling here, since they doubled down previously from Skyward-PhantomHourGlass?</p>

                <p>As we glide directly into the Famine of Canaan</p> 
                <p>Which is also featured with the Gorons being to cold to gather food when it should be Spring. Here also enters the Zoras who can not not fish because the Waters are odd and very murky to where they can not see.</p>

                <p>The Gerudos complain about the same thing, and so does a Fisherman lusting for a Picture of a Gerudo. This is no accident this is perfect Biblical account as we will come to see.</p>

                <p>As finally we come to The Tower of Babel in the heart of Ikana(Canaan) called Stone Tower - decked out with Baphomet/Moloch imagery with a idol of Majora inside which houses twin cities Sodom and Gomorrah.</p> 

                <p>That is 4 for 4</p>
                <p>Deku(Issac), Goron(Ishmael), Zora(Famine), Link.</p>

                <p>It may also be important to note here the Deku is of no help in Stone Tower Temple being far to light to do anything - for Issac has not yet been born. Which will tie us directly into "A Link Between Worlds" and "TriForce Heros(Green[Link], Blue[Zora], Red[Goron])"</p> 

                <p>What is the evidence of this?</p>
                <p>This breakdown should have already answered that. But, to answer this question we must understand the Story itself. Lets walk through Majoras Mask and in great detail that will be undeniable. This I guarantee.</p></div></div></section>

        <article id="MajM">
            <p>It is important to understand this part of the Official TimeLine is not in order by the official Timeline story - but however it is in order of Link himself and the Zelda story.</p>
            <p>As we will see a very Job like Main Focus. However, it is not Jobs lamentations - it is in fact the story of Abraham. Again you can say I am Cherry Picking however if that were True then someone please explain the next Chapters in Majoras Mask where one of those Zelda "Mistakes" happens yet again. I mean Alot... I mean word for word.</p>

            <p>Here we have the Next 4 Chapters in Majoras Mask.</p>

                <p>These 4 Chapters represent the 4 Masked Links, Deku, Zora, and Goron - this will bring us to the 4 Swords ; we will get there. For now we have alot of ground to cover.</p>
                <p>Just as WindWaker - to this very point in Majoras Mask - are out of order story wise - Here, these 4 Stories are backwards.</p>
                <p>The reasoning here will become quite blatant and amazing which plays into the 3 day Count Down.</p></article>

            <section class="comment-content">
                <p class="tc">Lets get into the nitty gritty.</p>

                <p>There is no place better to start than The land of Termina itself which is the land of Death as we will later see this is Lo(w)Rule the opposite of Hy(igh)Rule.</p>

                <p>Termina = Terminal. Terminal is defined as meaning :</p><p class="tc"> Leading ultimately to death : fatal; approaching or close to death : being in the final stages of a fatal disease; of or relating to patients with a terminal illness.</p>

                <p>This is the definition referenced time and time again - with this literally being the entire theme of the entire game. Whether impending doom of the end of the world - to every other type of misery, heartbreak, and loss possible.</p>
                <p>Such as the dead Zora named Mikau whom attempted to rescue his children who were kidnapped - leaving his Wife all alone to deal with the loss of Mikau and her Eggs/Children in the hands of the kidnappers.</p> 
                <p>You must carry on Mikau soul to bring peace to him and rescue Lulus Eggs/Children.</p> 
                <p>Then we have a dead Goron named Darmani III whos soul you also carry with you. Whom lost his life trying to find out the source of why Spring had not come but instead a blizzard that brought starvation and death upon his tribe that seemed to come from Snowhead Temple.</p>

                <p>Which brings us to the Deku who Majora killed(Child Sacrifice) and turned Link into the Deku Child using the Deku Child's Soul. Whom we see later the Deku Butler mourning his dead son.</p>

                <p class="tc">Welcome to Termina aka Babylon, where Majora represents Baal.
                <br>This is what makes Majoras Mask so incredibly dark.</p>

                <p>This theme continues to the crucial central focus of Death around Time of 3 days remaining before everyone, and thing is destroyed - which we see reflected in all the characters with each suffering in misery, heartbreak, and loss.</p>

                <p>By this moment I believe this should be a pretty solid foundation to bring in the 4 lands and the 4 giants.</p>

    <p class="tc">The goal here is to quickly give a visual</p>
    <p>Anyone who is even just surface familiar with scripture will see this is word for word.</br> For those not familiar with scripture nor Zelda - specifically Majoras Mask this may have got a little confusing. As stated at the very beginning everything is reversed. Many would think TwinMold would be Sodom and Gomorrah - this is the first duality (TwinMold is but isn't). As we will see there are Two Towers in Majoras Mask. One Tower makes no sense until we look at the scripture and understand Stone Tower and SnowHead are one of the same.</p>  
    <p>When we get into the tremendous detail as we continue things will clear themselves up as I will do best to keep the visuals as to avoid getting lost in text. However, I am also aware that to many images will only create confusion. The main purpose of jumping a little ahead is more for those who are scripture aware and or Zelda/Majora Mask enthusiast - wide array I am attempting to write for.</p>
    <p>However, I don't want to get lost in visual either at this point all the important factors are bullet pointed.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind Game and Story Mechanics, as the power of Duality - this is a very important thing to understand. So without further distraction lets jump into where this all goes.</p>

The four kings seized all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food, and they went on their way. They also carried off Abram’s nephew Lot and his possessions, since Lot was living in Sodom.

Where they debate was burned to death by the sodomites(in other words dont believe God turned her to salt - jews hate God) or claiming Lot had 4 daughters(they will believe anything except scripture).

(Pa)mela means Made from Honey as (Pa)ltith describes what Pamela does by checking out the "Well" this is how we get her out of the house so we can enter... in a house powered by "Water" represented by Maikus(Abraham) Guirtar, feeding and caring for someone who was only alive because she kept him safe(Pamelas Father). Therefore the Lot reference in LNST has only solidified and checks out. As the Judges account takes it further and only goes to show how bad Sodom and Gomorrah really was - Christ killing mongrel jews would execute you for being made of Honey and feeding people. With jews you lose dont ever trust these Canaanites I like to call them Cainanites its more fitting.

            <p>Now Shinar is Babylonia and identification with the Kingdom of Khana. 
                The Kingdom of Khana is called (Ikana Canyon) in Majoras Mask this is where the Tower of babel aka Stone Tower is located.<br>
                More famously known as Babylonia(Termina).<br>
                Here we have two warring factors over the collapsing empire.</p>
                <p>One faction is The King of Ikana who sits on the throne inside the Castle of Ikana.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="blog-content">
                <p>"You who bring light into darkness, I am the King of Ikana Kingdom, Igos du Ikana."<br> 
                — Igos du Ikana</p>

                <p>Igos du Ikana is an anagram.</p>
                <p>Guido(Italian) Ikana or U is God Ikana.<br>
                    There are quite a few ways this can go - this could also be reference to sui(Mongols) Genghis Kahn which would be far fetched and that being the only evidence of such an event or reference. However, can also represent Phoenicia which is much more plausible and provable, but not really concrete.</p>
                <p>The best translation and one I go with is understanding this is babylon we are talking about.<br>
                    Like Pharaoh and most Kings they saw themselves as Gods.<br>
                    So when they call him Igos du Ikana, they are addressing him by saying :<br> 
                    "You is God(King) Ikana".</p>

            <section class="comment-content">
                <p>The other faction are the Garo. Which have a suicide ritual normally with Bombs most likely shouting allah akbar when defeated in battle. However, this may or may not be the actual case due to the fact Garos are Master Spies, and most all Spies have such a protocol/ritual. Will get into all this in Race - here we are simply explaining Babylon aka Majoras Mask.</p>

            </section>

                <p class="bh">Genesis 10:19</p>
                <p class="tc pi">"And the border of the Canaanites was from {Sidon}, as thou comest to Gerar(this is a passthru), unto {Gaza}; as thou goest, unto [Sodom, and Gomorrah], and [Admah], and {Zeboim}, even unto {Lasha}."</p>
            </section>
            <section class="comment-content">
                <h5 class="tc">Gaza : WoodLand Temple</h5> 
                <br>
                    <p>You have to look at Palestine as it was then. It was a desert, a mosquito-infested swamp this is also the Mesopotamian Marshes. The unique wetland landscape is home to Marsh people, descended from the Ur, Sumer, and Babylon civilizations.</p>
                <br>

                <h5 class="tc">Lasha : SnowHead Temple</h5> 
                <br>
                    <p>functioned as a harbor site for the Mountain fortress of Machaerus(SnowHead Temple).
                Here the Gorons are found once you pass Mountain Village, and will see SnowHead Temple is not Goron built. As Goron Shrine is found in Goron Village past Mountain Village.</p>
                <br> 

                <h5 class="tc">Sidon : Great Bay Temple</h5> 
                <br>
                <p>A Phoenician city on the Mediterranean coast, also a son of Canaan.
                Sidon & Tyre are just like Sodom & Gomorrah, in depiction as 1 for they are commonly synonymous together as one location/event. Here Tyre is not referenced in Scripture.</p>

                <p>All of this is also as we will see is depicted from the scripture in Game.
                Which also features Gerudos(jews-Gomorrah), Zoras(White pagans-Sidon), and Beavers(pretty sure this is Sodom) each with their own dedicated spots.</p>

                <p>As everything here is centered around the Zora(Sidon) Eggs(Babies) being kidnapped by jewrudos(jews), who managed to lose some of the Zora eggs/children at Pinnacle Rock(Tyre)</p>

                <p>However, like stated then there is also Pinnacle Rock - which is full of Sea Snakes(Deep Pythons) and gold-colored fish(Seahorse) which is Tyre the Port City of a Deep Spiral(Pinnacle) we will get into this later.</p>  
                <br>

                <h5 class="tc">Zeboim & Admah : Stone Tower Temple</h5>
                <br>
                <p>Which is Land of the Hyenas and just like Sodom, Gomorrah, Sidon, and Tyre being interchangeable - as is also a repeating cycle throughout this entire theory with the Zoras/Gerudos. Only here we have Zeboim(Garos) & Admah(Stalfos) both found in the Canyon.</p>
                <p>This is also where the Stone Tower(Tower of Babel) is located, with a Statue of Moloch/Baphomet as the temple, and the first thing you see when you walk in is a Stone idol of Majora.</p>

                <p>With all this Information we are clearly seeing the Story of Babylon Scripturally perfect come into focus. You can not rationally tell me these are all mistakes like the Mirror Shield supposedly being a "mistake".</p>

                Better known as "Tattle"(to tell secrets about what someone else has done)" and "Tale(a usually imaginative narrative of an event - a series of events or facts told or presented)".</p>

                <P>Now if Zelda keeps making these "mistakes" they sure go way out of there way to make them.<br>
                    For we are fixing to see another one that explains the Names and why there are 2 Fairy's in Majoras Mask with the name Tattle Tell.</P>
            <section class="bible-content">
                <p class="bh">Deuteronomy 19:15</p>
                <p class="tc pi">"One witness(Fairy) shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses(Fairy's), or at the mouth of three witnesses(Link, Tatl, and Tael), shall the matter be established."</p>
                <p>Links a Tattle Tell or The Secret Tale of Link.</p>
            </section>

                <p>With that we now have the Whos, Whats, Whens, and Where - we just need the Why and How.</p>

                <p>Which brings us back to the TimeLine. Biblically Speaking We are way before Ocarina and much closer to Skyward Sword, It is important to note here that the Sword Link has is the Kokiri from Ocarina of Time.</p>

                <p>Which, we can now understand the "4 Swords" and the "Minish Cap" all referenced here and now in "Majoras Mask".</p>

                <p>But where does it fit... lets look at this from a realistic point of view. Biblically, it comes Third after Windwaker, however by the rules of Time it would come Second.</p>

                <p>If we say directly after "SkyWard Sword" and before "Minish Cap" this would mean after Link leaves Termina and returns to Hyrule - here we are introduced to the Minish/Picori. Which is interesting enough to be a direct link to the Kokiri of Ocarina of Time. Where they the Picori take the legendary blade of Kokiri and the Picori protect it hiding it in the forest after Vaati ruins the Legendary Celebration.</p>

                <p>Which is hidden in the same place you find it hidden in a little hole in Kokiri Forest in Ocarina of Time.</p> 

                <p>Important to understand this is not the "Master Sword" which was sealed in the Temple of Time in Skyward Sword.<br>
                The Master Sword only gets pulled once in Ocarina of Time which causes the TimeLine Split.<br>
                It is only pulled again once on this Child Time Line where it technically was never used in Ocarina of Time but was pulled in Twilight Princess which we will see falls in perfect place with the Biblical Timeline.</p> 
                <p>Will get more into the Swords in [Shielded] - as into Twilight Princess later in the TimeLine.</p> 

                <p>Yet, if we say After Minish Cap and before 4 Swords - then nothing really makes since how the Kokiri blade is actually the Picori Blade, for there would be 2 different Swords, meanwhile the story of Babylon is older coming after Skyward Sword, and before the Minish Cap biblically. 

                so this is where we will put it for it removes every contradiction.

                Specially when we consider Majoras Mask is a Pivotal game in the TimeLine Split. The Kokiri Sword is the "White Sword" Featured in Every game after SkyWard Sword - Majoras Mask(Kokiri/Gilded-Simple past tense and past participle), Minish Cap(Picori/White/4Sword) to become the 4 Swords(Keep in mind the 4 identified formed in Majora Mask), which brings us Right back into the Ocarina of Time where we start with the Picori Blade-Kokiri Blade in search of the Master Sword which must be pulled. 

                In other words:

                TimeLine speaking we see Skyward Sword in which really is Deuteronomy/Exodus/Numbers - more than the Genesis Creation Story. However, this can easily be seen to form a clear visual of a Foundation in that very sense. 

                Then we Move into the Genesis Accounts of Babylon.(Majoras Mask)

                Which moves us along into Minish Cap. Where Vaati(Demon) steals a WishCap(*cough* little hat) and shape-shifts between 4(types), kidnaps women, and takes them to his palace, and acts nearly identical to Majora(Mask) aka Baal - It is here in Majoras mask the parallelism is made - where we learn the "Elegy of Emptiness".

            </section>

                Finally, into Four Swords. Where Vaati breaks free again where again we see the same Parallelism from exactly the same conversation.
