Through Him all things were made, and without Him nothing was made that has been made. In Him was life, and that life was the light of men.

                    <p>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</p>

                    <p>This is covered in much more detail here ... <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Religon">The WindFish</a> <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Race">The Ocean Kings</a> <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Religon">Firmament</a> </p>
                    <p>SkyLoft is the Garden of Eden where the Goddess Hylia decides to become Mortal in the name of Possessing the TriForce - this is Zelda desiring to touch the Forbidden Fruit.</p>
                    <p>This desire causes Zelda to be sucked from the Heavens/Garden of Eden via tornado by a Demon named Ghirahim <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Race">Demons</a> <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Religon">Ruminations</a> who calls himself Demon Lord and current ruler of the Twilight Surface whom is in pursuit to resurrect an ancient demon, Demise aka Death/Sin the darkness that once covered the entire earth.</p>
                    <p>The Next part are Prophecies and Defining Roles using stories for identification and reasoning.</p>
                    <p>This is where we meet Levias <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Religon">The WindFish</a> <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Race">The Ocean Kings</a> <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Religon">Firmament</a> who is infected with Bilocyte <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Race">Demons</a> a mind controlling parasite turning Levias into Leviathan. Which is a reoccurring and important theme throughout Zelda.</p>
                    <P>The plot would lead you to believe Hylia/Zelda had this elaborate plan - but nothing could be further from the truth. In the beginning Zelda is hearing a voice speaking where she ask you if you can hear it too, this is where her desire for the surface comes from, this is what plants the idea in her mind to posses the TriForce which is in this regard being the forbidden fruit, which she can not touch in her current state being that she is not a mortal.</P>
                    <p>All of this to put fourth the real plan which was a deception to capture and sacrifice Zelda to the demon king which is exactly what unfolds to happen. Zeldas "plan" is the great lie - just as everything to do with Goddesses and all the other concepts that were forced... both in game and outside due to political correctness and the Agahnim, Ghirahim, and Ganondorfs of demise at the ADL. Where many took that deception hook, line, and sinker.</p>
                    <p>Here in SkyWard Sword Zelda has officially stripped Hylia from False Idol status : by using Eve to place her back in her Original Intended State (pun intended) and destroy this pagan goddesses Myth of Hyrule and the Real World believed. "It is of importance to realize in the Opening the Goddesses were not mentioned - instead it is the Gods of Old, where Hylia was the only Goddess with the Blessing from the Gods of Old. </p>

                    <h5 class="bh">Genesis 3:22-24</h5>
                    <p>Then the LORD God said, “Behold, <strong>the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil.</strong> And now, lest he reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever...” <strong>Therefore the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.</strong> So <strong>He drove out the man and stationed cherubim on the east side of the Garden of Eden, along with a whirling sword of flame to guard the way to the tree of life.</strong> </section>
                <p>As Fi makes extremely clear her absolute devotion to Her Creator. </p>
                <p>Just as the removal of the Cross being the Original lens of truth. With Titles censored to name changes such as A Link to the Past.. which makes no sense to come after Ocarina of Time, sense time stops when you consider the Imprisoning War and Triforce of the Gods the non-censored name of a Link to the Past you quickly realize it was censorship that caused this confusion, it was Political Correctness that causes the confusion. In Which SkywardSword put to bed all of it here and now to diminish all the Hyrulian Myths of goddesses and timeline split babble.</p>
                <section class="blog">"This is a tale which humans have told for many ages, generation to generation, but there are other legends hidden far away from memory, that are intertwined with this tale.

                    <h5 class="bh">Genesis 3:2-5</h5>
                    <p>The woman answered the serpent, “We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden, but about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You must not eat of it or touch it, or you will die.’</p>
                    <p>“You will not surely die,” the serpent told her. “For God knows that in the day you eat of it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”</p>

                    <p>Another important part here is the idea this makes Link a fallen angel which is not true for there were others before this time who fell through the cloud barrier which if called the Imprisoning War the very beginning of the "Fallen Timeline" how one still challenges the true nature of this is quite fascinating.</p>
                    <p>Neither the Adult Timeline nor the Fallen Timeline are actual splits in the Timeline - that Imprisoning War takes us to "A Link to the Past" which predates SkyWard Sword, the Adult Timeline never took place because of a Split in the Timeline it is because Adam(Child) to Noah(Adult).</p>
                    <p>You can thank alot of this on political cancel culture, ADL, and every other anti-White Christian for such secrecy. To be absolutely honest it only made Zelda that much better.</p>
                    <p>Ghirahim seems to be one of those of old who did in fact fall through the cloud barrier metaphorically with him being Demise's literal right hand man being demises ultimate weapon : a Sword <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Race">Sword</a> which would explain how he knew how to reach the barrier and get just close enough to tempt, and lure Zelda out of the Garden, by offering the forbidden fruit, that made her mortal.</p>

                    <p>"This is no easy task, Link. The world below is a forsaken place, and to reach it you must pierce the cloud barrier below. In living memory, no one has ever done this." — Gaepora (Skyward Sword)</p>
                    <p>"I am the Demon Lord who presides over this land you look down upon, this world you call the surface. You may call me Ghirahim. In truth, I very much prefer to be indulged with my full title:Lord Ghirahim." — Ghirahim (Skyward Sword)</p>

It's a character flaw of mine." — Ghirahim (Skyward Sword)</p>

                <section class="comment-content">
                    <p>This is the entire reason SkyLoft exist in the very first place to represent the Garden of Eden out of reach of the demons I believe we can move on from the Garden of Eden and move to the surface world and now we can move into where we get our first prophecy of the Flood to come : that takes place in WindWaker. We learn this from a particular Kikwi <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Race">Deku</a> named Yerbal(Think Herbal) who lives on the Great Tree <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Race">Deku Tree</a> in Faron Woods.</p>
                    <p>It is noteworthy to add here that Yerbal is a hermit and as the name suggest is a shrub that matures into a tree. This will become relevant later as we get further in the TimeLine.</p>
                    <p>Yerbal is not a fan of people - therefore is a hermit in isolation - and like most hermits that does not mean they are quiet - hence think Noah only this time the story is an admixture with Moses. We will see both prophecies and hear both accounts, telling both stories one playing off the other - using each - on the key similarities - which is tied with a bow at the end.</p>
                    <p>This is the genius behind Zelda by the way.</p>
                    <p>If you have read Link NatSoc Theory Synopsis - a lot of this information is referenced and should be familiar. Yet, in the Case of Yerbal he was not added to the Synopsis due to the case that Yerbal indicates the Flood : he does not help to bring about the flood when Faron Forrest Floods. This particular Flood event is not the Flood but is in-fact the expansion of the <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Race">Zoras</a> population, which as we will see in WindWaker is also the indication and reason of what is to come in <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Race">WindWaker</a>.</p>
                    <p>This Topic is all about transference when a Kingdom takes a Kingdom, throughout time. Will get into the details of War in <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Race">Dragons</a> - but here there are 2 Main wars that need to be Noted and need to be understood since I told you the Prophecy of Noah and Moses.</p>

                    <p>"He is a hermit of the herbivorous Kikwi race. He climbed a tree and never came down, thus becoming a hermit." — Fi (Skyward Sword)</p>
                    <p>"They used to call me Yerbal. Now I'm just the old Kikwi hermit. I watch over this forest here...when I'm not nappin'." — Yerbal (Skyward Sword)</p>
                    <p> "There's a problem, though. The gate that leads to that lake is sealed shut to all those judged unworthy... But don't worry, kwwwwrk. I'll let you in on the trick to opening the gate." — Yerbal (Skyward Sword)</p>
                    <p>"Ah, yes... That cackling, old hermit Kikwi told you where I live, didn't he? Honestly, I can't remember how many times I've told that scruffy thing to keep his mouth shut. That's the last straw. Next time I see him, he's dinner!" — Faron (Skyward Sword)</p>

                    <p>It is of due importance to understand Farons invasion of Farron Forrest we will mark as Noahs Story. For it is Identical to Lanayru Province which is the parallelism which we will mark Moses Story.</p>
                    <p>Lanayru Province has been left barren in which was mined til there was practically nothing left, covered in ruins, and broken atrifact pieces which were robots aka slaves that can only be seen in the past the same as Lanayru.</p>
                    <p>This is not the Let my People Go part of the TimeLine - it is using the reference just as using the Flood of Farron Forrest to explain times past, using events that have not happened yet which are Prophecies being made.</p>
                    <p>Which through Faron (Noahs Story) gives us the (Moses Story) as we are going to see. Keep in mind none of this has yet happened in TimeLine - it is simply what left the earth formless and void, and the darkness that was over the surface of the deep.</p>
                    <p>Where was Yerbal the Hermit when the Farron Forrest was flooded?</p>

                    <p>"Yes... This mountain was not always such a dangerous and unforgiving place. There was a time when those above-ground and those below lived together in harmony by the blessing of the great mountain. The desolation that you see now is all that remains to remind us of those glorious days..." — Eldin (Skyward Sword)</p>

                    <p>I will give you a few hints to consider.
                        <br> 1. If Faron represents the prophecy of Noah. 2. If Lauryn represents the Prophecy of Moses. 3. Who, Prophecy, Time, and Place who would fit perfectly to give the Prophecy considering the fall of man?

                    <p>Eventually, extinguishing the flames blocking the entrance to the Fire Sanctuary, allowing you to continue the adventure to find the final of the Sacred Flames.</p>
