                        <p>From the Basics, to the obscure details. Our adventure starts here.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you skimmed the Link NatSoc TimeLine you will notice it looks radically different than the Original/Official Timeline. If one looks closer you will begin to see it is the Very Exact Same TimeLine as the Original/Official Timeline.</p>
                        <p>Breaking this Theory up for the way of Presentation in the the way that I have has been Challenging to say the least. The Timeline is Religion, as Religion is the Racial TimeLine - for this reason I have decided the best way to explain the TimeLine without duplicating "Link NatSoc Theory : Religiously Faithful", "Link NatSoc Theory : Shielded Items", "Link NatSoc Theory : Racials", and "Link NatSoc Theory : TriForce" is by only referencing where absolutely necessary for understanding.</p>
                        <p>However, here we will Focus on the Entire Picture in chronological order here therefore we are forced to follow the Biblical Aspect and the Major Events.</p>

                        <p>As I Focused on "Ocarina Of Time" in the <a href="https://www.NineNeins.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Synopsis"> "Link NatSoc Theory : Synopsis"</a> due to the Ocarina being the Central piece of the Story/Time - as well as being the most known to the masses allowing room to Introduce everything in a FreeForm Fashion allowing me the Freedom to Jump Up and Down the TimeLine to Solidify my Presentation. This also granted a path to create a Wide Scope Introduction, Text Format, Creative Ideas, and a to the point breakdown.</p>

                        <p>However, the TimeLine is much more important THAN EVER especially now that many are attempting to say the TimeLine is irrelevant (much like Our Own History), as the Zelda Dev Team Obviously "with Breath of the Wild" have proven that just is not the case.</p> 

                        <p>Making the Story and TimeLine even more so IMPORTANT. The Team(Whether consciously as a Whole in which I doubt - or where it really matters which is absolutely most likely) was absolutely sure to make sure the TimeLine of the Story is indeed Crucial.</p>

                        <p>Which if one reads this Theory "Breath of the Wild" will instantly begin to making Perfect Sense. Please, keep in mind those that push the narrative the TimeLine/Story is irrelevant are the same ones who will write off the "Mirror Shield" as a mistake. Really!</p><br></article></div></section>

                        <p>You may look at this Theory as nonsense, stupid, pathetic, or a waste of time. However, that does not change anything presented here.</p> 
                        <p>There are tons of other materials at disposal if I had interest in nonsense, stupid, pathetic, ridiculousness, and just wanted to waste time. Yet, I am no fan of nonsense, stupid, pathetic, or wasting time.</p>
                        <p>This is what inspired me to sit down and actully bring this presentation to life.</p>
                        <p>If one wishes or wanted to waste time they would cover Harry Potter, or StarWars, or Tolkien, Matrix and plenty of other stories, topics, writers, etc - the problem there is these are not stories of Christianity.</p> 
                        <p>Sure you can point to references, symbolism, or parts, or lines, or even scenery, title, characters, ect. Yet, at the end of the day they are pulling at nothing trying to create a narrative that is not there.</p>
                        <p>Who is behind it - and Why does it exist - will destroy 100% of all claims if you use these sources mentioned above. There is no Christianity in them, plenty of blasphemy but zilch of Christianity.

                        <p>Every Story has an influence and no doubt Christianity is pulled from all the time - that does not make a work Christian - it does not make it True - it does not suddenly represent Christianity - and if that is what someone is trying to do - you are but wasteing your time. As I stated I am no fan of that concept.</p>
                        <p>Every story has a central influence, narrative, message, and recreation. This is critical to understand and acknowledge. Nothing comes and/or is created out of nothing and from nowhere.</p>

                        <p>Zelda is no different when it come to these facts, it is the greatest representation of Christianity ever done it is the Central narrative. This is not a waste of time to bring to light - but a disection of one of the greatest masterpiece works of absolute art.</p> 
                        <p>With every step of the way through Links NatSoc Theory you will learn so much - you will walk through the Bible with every step, explore History at every turn, and play one of the Greatest Games and Hear the story that requires no console, purchase, or controller in vivid imaginative detail - to solve the greatest Puzzle that took a Lifetime to create.</p>
                        <p>Thats not a sales pitch for I have nothing at all to gain from putting Link NatSoc Theory together. Do not mistake me and assuming I am advocating Zelda as a substitute for the Bible - it is not. Quite the contrary, Zelda is a representative story of the Bible.</p>
                        <p>I only invite you to come on an adventure with me.</p>

            <p class="tc">Race, Religions, Story, Artifacts, and History seem like random things.</p><p>In fact, Links name was the first clue to that one should have pondered on. Yes it is all Linked, your second clue was Time, your final clue was Story. When all put side by side it becomes crystal clear that everything is meticulously connected. Whether that be purposeful, non intentional, or plagurized accident - does not change the fact that Zelda is indeed meticulously connected.</p> 

            <p>Which is it? I leave that for you to decide. I will say however, considering how blatant it is, obviously in your face, to the point plausible deniability is ruled out to to the sheer volume of intricate details - I do believe it is intentional.</p>

            <p class="tc"><strong>Soon you will see the battlefield for the first time.<br> This is a war and every war has one thing in common<br> with every other war.<br> Death.</strong></p> 

            <p> However we wont be talking about the Split of the TimeLine first, instead we will be Starting Back at the Very Beginning in Majoras Mask... oops spoiler... I mean further back to the Interloper War... no, hmm not there, how about we start when the Earth Flooded... nope. We have to go even further back.</p>

            <p>So where? How about right here at the Imprisoning War, wait now thats to far back, better save the first for last and do the last first. Yes, better to do that so that way it will all make sense. The Fall of Man aka Skyward Sword is where we will start.</p>

                    <p>Now that the merits of a connection are set we can get into the TimeLine.</p>

                    <p>This is where we meet Levias <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Religon">The WindFish</a> <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Race">The Ocean Kings</a> <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Religon">Firmament</a> who is infected with Bilocyte <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Race">Demons</a> a mind controlling parasite turning Levias into Leviathan. Which is a reoccurring and important theme throughout Zelda.</p>
                    <P>The plot would lead you to believe Hylia/Zelda had this elaborate plan - but nothing could be further from the truth. In the beginning Zelda is hearing a voice speaking where she ask you if you can hear it too, this is where her desire for the surface comes from, this is what plants the idea in her mind to posses the TriForce which is in this regard being the forbidden fruit, which she can not touch in her current state being that she is not a mortal.</P>
                    <p>All of this to put fourth the real plan which was a deception to capture and sacrifice Zelda to the demon king which is exactly what unfolds to happen. Zeldas "plan" is the great lie - just as everything to do with Goddesses and all the other concepts that were forced... both in game and outside due to political correctness and the Agahnim, Ghirahim, and Ganondorfs of demise at the ADL. Where many took that deception hook, line, and sinker.</p>
                    <p>Here in SkyWard Sword Zelda has officially stripped Hylia from False Idol status : by using Eve to place her back in her Original Intended State (pun intended) and destroy this pagan goddesses Myth of Hyrule and the Real World believed. "It is of importance to realize in the Opening the Goddesses were not mentioned - instead it is the Gods of Old, where Hylia was the only Goddess with the Blessing from the Gods of Old. </p>

                    <h5 class="bh">Genesis 3:22-24</h5>
                    <p>Then the LORD God said, “Behold, <strong>the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil.</strong> And now, lest he reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever...” <strong>Therefore the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.</strong> So <strong>He drove out the man and stationed cherubim on the east side of the Garden of Eden, along with a whirling sword of flame to guard the way to the tree of life.</strong> </section>
                <p>As Fi makes extremely clear her absolute devotion to Her Creator. </p>
                <p>Just as the removal of the Cross being the Original lens of truth. With Titles censored to name changes such as A Link to the Past.. which makes no sense to come after Ocarina of Time, sense time stops when you consider the Imprisoning War and Triforce of the Gods the non-censored name of a Link to the Past you quickly realize it was censorship that caused this confusion, it was Political Correctness that causes the confusion. In Which SkywardSword put to bed all of it here and now to diminish all the Hyrulian Myths of goddesses and timeline split babble.</p>

                    <p>“You will not surely die,” the serpent told her. “For God knows that in the day you eat of it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”</p>

                    <p>Another important part here is the idea this makes Link a fallen angel which is not true for there were others before this time who fell through the cloud barrier which if called the Imprisoning War the very beginning of the "Fallen Timeline" how one still challenges the true nature of this is quite fascinating.</p>
                    <p>Neither the Adult Timeline nor the Fallen Timeline are actual splits in the Timeline - that Imprisoning War takes us to "A Link to the Past" which predates SkyWard Sword, the Adult Timeline never took place because of a Split in the Timeline it is because Adam(Child) to Noah(Adult).</p>
                    <p>You can thank alot of this on political cancel culture, ADL, and every other anti-White Christian for such secrecy. To be absolutely honest it only made Zelda that much better.</p>
                    <p>Ghirahim seems to be one of those of old who did in fact fall through the cloud barrier metaphorically with him being Demise's literal right hand man being demises ultimate weapon : a Sword <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Race">Sword</a> which would explain how he knew how to reach the barrier and get just close enough to tempt, and lure Zelda out of the Garden, by offering the forbidden fruit, that made her mortal.</p>

                    <p>"This is no easy task, Link. The world below is a forsaken place, and to reach it you must pierce the cloud barrier below. In living memory, no one has ever done this." — Gaepora (Skyward Sword)</p>
                    <p>"I am the Demon Lord who presides over this land you look down upon, this world you call the surface. You may call me Ghirahim. In truth, I very much prefer to be indulged with my full title:Lord Ghirahim." — Ghirahim (Skyward Sword)</p>

                    <p>This is the entire reason SkyLoft exist in the very first place to represent the Garden of Eden out of reach of the demons I believe we can move on from the Garden of Eden and move to the surface world and now we can move into where we get our first prophecy of the Flood to come : that takes place in WindWaker. We learn this from a particular Kikwi <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Race">Deku</a> named Yerbal(Think Herbal) who lives on the Great Tree <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Race">Deku Tree</a> in Faron Woods.</p>
                    <p>It is noteworthy to add here that Yerbal is a hermit and as the name suggest is a shrub that matures into a tree. This will become relevant later as we get further in the TimeLine.</p>
                    <p>Yerbal is not a fan of people - therefore is a hermit in isolation - and like most hermits that does not mean they are quiet - hence think Noah only this time the story is an admixture with Moses. We will see both prophecies and hear both accounts, telling both stories one playing off the other - using each - on the key similarities - which is tied with a bow at the end.</p>
                    <p>This is the genius behind Zelda by the way.</p>
                    <p>If you have read Link NatSoc Theory Synopsis - a lot of this information is referenced and should be familiar. Yet, in the Case of Yerbal he was not added to the Synopsis due to the case that Yerbal indicates the Flood : he does not help to bring about the flood when Faron Forrest Floods. This particular Flood event is not the Flood but is in-fact the expansion of the <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Race">Zoras</a> population, which as we will see in WindWaker is also the indication and reason of what is to come in <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Race">WindWaker</a>.</p>
                    <p>This Topic is all about transference when a Kingdom takes a Kingdom, throughout time. Will get into the details of War in <a class="badge bg-secondary text-decoration-none link-light" href="https://ninenein.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Race">Dragons</a> - but here there are 2 Main wars that need to be Noted and need to be understood since I told you the Prophecy of Noah and Moses.</p>

                    <p>"They used to call me Yerbal. Now I'm just the old Kikwi hermit. I watch over this forest here...when I'm not nappin'." — Yerbal (Skyward Sword)</p>
                    <p> "There's a problem, though. The gate that leads to that lake is sealed shut to all those judged unworthy... But don't worry, kwwwwrk. I'll let you in on the trick to opening the gate." — Yerbal (Skyward Sword)</p>
                    <p>"Ah, yes... That cackling, old hermit Kikwi told you where I live, didn't he? Honestly, I can't remember how many times I've told that scruffy thing to keep his mouth shut. That's the last straw. Next time I see him, he's dinner!" — Faron (Skyward Sword)</p>

                    <p>It is of due importance to understand Farons invasion of Farron Forrest we will mark as Noahs Story. For it is Identical to Lanayru Province which is the parallelism which we will mark Moses Story.</p>
                    <p>Lanayru Province has been left barren in which was mined til there was practically nothing left, covered in ruins, and broken atrifact pieces which were robots aka slaves that can only be seen in the past the same as Lanayru.</p>
                    <p>This is not the Let my People Go part of the TimeLine - it is using the reference just as using the Flood of Farron Forrest to explain times past, using events that have not happened yet which are Prophecies being made.</p>
                    <p>Which through Faron (Noahs Story) gives us the (Moses Story) as we are going to see. Keep in mind none of this has yet happened in TimeLine - it is simply what left the earth formless and void, and the darkness that was over the surface of the deep.</p>
                    <p>Where was Yerbal the Hermit when the Farron Forrest was flooded?</p>

                    <p>They mounted a brutal assault upon the surface people, driving the land into deep despair... They burnt forests to ash, choked the land's sweet springs, and murdered without hesitation.</p>
                    <p>"Yes... This mountain was not always such a dangerous and unforgiving place. There was a time when those above-ground and those below lived together in harmony by the blessing of the great mountain. The desolation that you see now is all that remains to remind us of those glorious days..." — Eldin (Skyward Sword)</p>

                    <p>I will give you a few hints to consider.
                        <br> 1. If Faron represents the prophecy of Noah. 2. If Lauryn represents the Prophecy of Moses. 3. Who, Prophecy, Time, and Place who would fit perfectly to give the Prophecy considering the fall of man?

                        <p>It is here the Great Zelda Mystery Begins - WindWaker was not the Shocker due to its in your face imagery - other than its placement on the Official Timeline in which I fully support for the reasoning aspect of Time itself.</p>
                        <p>WindWaker(Adult Timeline) does exactly the same thing Majoras Mask does on the Child Timeline.</p> 
                        <p>Take notice that the very next Chapter Genesis 10 is missing.</p>
                        <p>There is Alot to go over here But in their respected Timeline we will get into all 3 of these in great detail.</p>
                        <p>The brevity was crucial in the Link NatSoc Theory - as we are fixing to understand why.</p>

                <p>These 4 Chapters represent the 4 Mask Link, Deku, Zora, and Goron - think of 4 Swords ; we will get there. For now we have alot of ground to cover.</p>
                <p>Just as WindWaker to this very point in Majoras Mask are out of order story wise - Here, these 4 Stories are backwards.</p>

                <p>The reasoning here will become quite blatant and amazing which plays into the 3 day Count Down.</p></article>

            <p>Lets get into the nitty gritty.</p>
            <p>The Mask Story starts once Link is transformed into a Deku.</p> 
            <p>This is "God Promises the Birth of Isaac" in Genesis 18.</p>

            <p>If you do not know  : the Body of the DekuChild granting us the Mask was the "Deku Butlers Son" who was murdered by Majora.</p>
            <p>This is the representation of the Sacrifice of Issac in Genesis 22, for Link now holds the promise of the Birth of Issac, which just to fill in for those unfamiliar "The Deku Butler(Servant)" the father(Abraham) of the "the slain son(Issac)" all gos back to the Great Deku Tree(Abraham) we will first encounter in Ocarina of Time.</p>
            <p>Here we get the first glimpse of the Time connection.</p>

            <p>Next on the list is Ishmael Birth.<br> Which takes place when we learn the "Gorons Lullaby" this is Baby Ishmale and if you have read the Sypnosis Everything about the Islamic Crest, Soundtrack, the Color Red, History, and Location many tell me was a "Zelda Mistake" then why are they doubleing down here?</p>

            <p>Then we come to the Famine of Canaan</p> <p>Which is also featured with the Gorons being to cold to gather food when it should be Spring. Here also enters the Zoras who can not not fish because the Waters are odd and very murky to where they can not see.</p>

            <p>The Gerudos complain about the same thing, and so does a Fisherman who wants a Picture of a Gerudo.</p>

            <p>Finally we come to The Tower of Babel in the heart of Ikana(Canaan) called Stone Tower - decked out with Baphomet/Moloch imagery with a idol of Majora inside.</p> 

            <p>That is 4 for 4</p>
            <p>Deku(Issac), Goron(Ishmael), Zora(Famine), Link.</p>

            <p>It may also be important to note here the Deku is of no help in Stone Temple being far to light to do anything - for Issac has not yet been born. Which will tie us directly into "A Link Between Worlds" and "TriForce Heros(Green[Link], Blue[Zora], Red[Goron]"</p> 

            <p>What is the evidence of this?</p>
            <p>To answer this question we must understand the Story itself.</p>

            <p>There is no place better to start than The land of Termina itself which is the land of Death as we will later see this is Lo(w)Rule the opposite of Hy(igh)Rule.</p>

            <p>Termina = Terminal. Terminal is defined as meaning : Leading ultimately to death : fatal; approaching or close to death : being in the final stages of a fatal disease; of or relating to patients with a terminal illness.</p>

            <p>This is definition is referenced time and time again - with this literally being the entire theme of the entire game. Whether impending doom of the end of the world - to every other type of misery, heartbreak, and loss possible.</p>
            <p>Such as a dead Zora named Mikau whom attempted to rescue his children who were kidnapped - leaving his Wife all alone to deal with the loss of Mikau and her Eggs/Children in the hands of the kidnappers.</p> 
            <p>You must carry on Mikau soul to bring peace to him and rescue Lulus Eggs/Children.</p> 
            <p>A dead Goron named Darmani III whos soul you also carry with you. Whom lost his life trying to find out the source of why Spring had not come but only a blizzard that brought starvation and death upon his tribe that seemed to come from Snowhead Temple.</p>

            <p>Which brings us to the Deku who Majora killed(Child Sacrifice) and turned Link into the Deku Child using the Deku Child's Soul. Whom we see later the Deku Butler mourning his dead son.</p>

            <p>Welcome to Termina aka Babylon, where Majora represents Baal.</p>
            <p>This is what makes Majoras Mask so incredibly dark.</p>

            <p>This theme continues to the crucial central focus of Death around Time of 3 days remaining before everyone, and thing is destroyed - which we see reflected in all the characters with each suffering in misery, heartbreak, and loss.</p>

            <p>By this moment I believe this should be a pretty solid foundation to bring in the 4 lands and the 4 giants.</p>

            </section>
            <section class="comment-content">
            <p>Now Shinar is Babylonia and identification with the Kingdom of Khana. 
                The Kingdom of Khana is called (Ikana Canyon) in Majoras Mask this is where the Tower of babel aka Stone Tower is located.<br>
                More famously known as Babylonia(Termina).<br>
                Here we have two warring factors over the collapsing empire.</p>
                <p>One faction is The King of Ikana who sits on the throne inside the Castle of Ikana.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="blog-content">
                <p>"You who bring light into darkness, I am the King of Ikana Kingdom, Igos du Ikana."<br> 
                — Igos du Ikana</p>

                <p>Igos du Ikana is an anagram.</p>
                <p>Guido(Italian) Ikana or U is God Ikana.<br>
                    There are quite a few ways this can go - this could also be reference to sui(Mongols) Genghis Kahn which would be far fetched and that being the only evidence of such an event or reference. However, can also represent Phoenicia which is much more plausible and provable, but not really concrete.</p>
                <p>The best translation and one I go with is understanding this is babylon we are talking about.<br>
                    Like Pharaoh and most Kings they saw themselves as Gods.<br>
                    So when they call him Igos du Ikana, they are addressing him by saying :<br> 
                    "You is God(King) Ikana".</p>

                <p>"I commanded the Ikana Army atop the hill, in the name of the Ikana Kingdom. I am called Skull Keeta."<br> — Captain Keeta (Majoras Mask)</p>

            <section class="comment-content">
                <p>The other faction are the Garo. Which have a suicide ritual normally with Bombs most likely shouting allah akbar when defeated in battle. However, this may or may not be the actual case due to the fact Garos are Master Spies, and most all Spies have such a protocol/ritual. Will get into all this in Race - here we are simply explaining Babylon aka Majoras Mask.</p>

                <p class="tc">The evidence thus far is overwhelming isnt it? So lets continue and get back to Shinar.</p> 
            </section>
            <section class="bible-content">
                <p class="bh">Genesis 10:19</p>
                <p class="tc pi">"And the border of the Canaanites was from {Sidon}, as thou comest to Gerar(this is a passthru), unto {Gaza}; as thou goest, unto [Sodom, and Gomorrah], and [Admah], and {Zeboim}, even unto {Lasha}."</p>
            </section>
            <section class="comment-content">
                <h5 class="tc">Gaza : WoodLand Temple</h5> 
                <br>
                    <p>You have to look at Palestine as it was then. It was a desert, a mosquito-infested swamp this is also the Mesopotamian Marshes. The unique wetland landscape is home to Marsh people, descended from the Ur, Sumer, and Babylon civilizations.</p>
                <br>

                <h5 class="tc">Lasha : SnowHead Temple</h5> 
                <br>
                    <p>functioned as a harbor site for the Mountain fortress of Machaerus(SnowHead Temple).
                Here the Gorons are found once you pass Mountain Village, and will see SnowHead Temple is not Goron built. As Goron Shrine is found in Goron Village past Mountain Village.</p>
                <br> 

                <h5 class="tc">Sidon : Great Bay Temple</h5> 
                <br>
                <p>A Phoenician city on the Mediterranean coast, also a son of Canaan.
                Sidon & Tyre are just like Sodom & Gomorrah, in depiction as 1 for they are commonly synonymous together as one location/event. Here Tyre is not referenced in Scripture.</p>

                <p>All of this is also as we will see is depicted from the scripture in Game.
                Which also features Gerudos(jews-Gomorrah), Zoras(White pagans-Sidon), and Beavers(pretty sure this is Sodom) each with their own dedicated spots.</p>

                <p>As everything here is centered around the Zora(Sidon) Eggs(Babies) being kidnapped by jewrudos(jews), who managed to lose some of the Zora eggs/children at Pinnacle Rock(Tyre)</p>

                <p>However, like stated then there is also Pinnacle Rock - which is full of Sea Snakes(Deep Pythons) and gold-colored fish(Seahorse) which is Tyre the Port City of a Deep Spiral(Pinnacle) we will get into this later.</p>  
                <br>

                <h5 class="tc">Zeboim & Admah : Stone Tower Temple</h5>
                <br>
                <p>Which is Land of the Hyenas and just like Sodom, Gommorah, Sidon, and Tyre being interchangeable - as is also a repeating cycle throughout this entire theory with the Zoras/Gerudos. Only here we have Zeboim(Garos) & Admah(Stalfos) both found in the Canyon.</p>
                <p>This is also where the Stone Tower(Tower of Babel) is located, with a Statue of Moloch/Baphomet as the temple, and the first thing you see when you walk in is a Stone idol of Majora.</p>

                <p>With all this Information we are clearly seeing the Story of Babylon Scripturally perfect come into focus. You can not rationally tell me these are all mistakes like the Mirror Shield supposedly being a "mistake".</p>

                <p>Are you seeing the entire picture coming together?</p>

                <p>Lets bring in Tael who is a fairy and his sister is Tatl. Together they are TattleTale.
                Better known as "Tattle"(to tell secrets about what someone else has done)" and "Tale(a usually imaginative narrative of an event - a series of events or facts told or presented)".</p>

                <P>Now if Zelda keeps making these "mistakes" they sure go way out of there way to make them.<br>
                    For we are fixing to see another one that explains the Names and why there are 2 Fairy's in Majoras Mask with the name Tattle Tell.</P>
            <section class="bible-content">
                <p class="bh">Deuteronomy 19:15</p>
                <p class="tc pi">"One witness(Fairy) shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses(Fairy's), or at the mouth of three witnesses(Link, Tatl, and Tael), shall the matter be established."</p>
                <p>Links a Tattle Tell or The Secret Tale of Link.</p>
            </section>

                <p>With that we now have the Whos, Whats, Whens, and Where - we just need the Why and How.</p>

                <p>Which brings us back to the TimeLine. Biblically Speaking We are way before Ocarina and much closer to Skyward Sword, It is important to note here that the Sword Link has is the Kokiri from Ocarina of Time.</p>

                <p>Which, we can now understand the "4 Swords" and the "Minish Cap" all referenced here and now in "Majoras Mask".</p>

                <p>But where does it fit... lets look at this from a realistic point of view. Biblically, it comes Third after Windwaker, however by the rules of Time it would come Second.</p>

                <p>If we say directly after "SkyWard Sword" and before "Minish Cap" this would mean after Link leaves Termina and returns to Hyrule - here we are introduced to the Minish/Picori. Which is interesting enough to be a direct link to the Kokiri of Ocarina of Time. Where they the Picori take the legendary blade of Kokiri and the Picori protect it hiding it in the forest after Vaati ruins the Legendary Celebration.</p>

                <p>Which is hidden in the same place you find it hidden in a little hole in Kokiri Forest in Ocarina of Time.</p> 

                <p>Important to understand this is not the "Master Sword" which was sealed in the Temple of Time in Skyward Sword.<br>
                The Master Sword only gets pulled once in Ocarina of Time which causes the TimeLine Split.<br>
                It is only pulled again once on this Child Time Line where it technically was never used in Ocarina of Time but was pulled in Twilight Princess which we will see falls in perfect place with the Biblical Timeline.</p> 
                <p>Will get more into the Swords in [Shielded] - as into Twilight Princess later in the TimeLine.</p> 

                <p>Yet, if we say After Minish Cap and before 4 Swords - then nothing really makes since how the Kokiri blade is actually the Picori Blade, for there would be 2 different Swords, meanwhile the story of Babylon is older coming after Skyward Sword, and before the Minish Cap biblically. 

                so this is where we will put it for it removes every contradiction.

                Specially when we consider Majoras Mask is a Pivotal game in the TimeLine Split. The Kokiri Sword is the "White Sword" Featured in Every game after SkyWard Sword - Majoras Mask(Kokiri/Gilded-Simple past tense and past participle), Minish Cap(Picori/White/4Sword) to become the 4 Swords(Keep in mind the 4 identified formed in Majora Mask), which brings us Right back into the Ocarina of Time where we start with the Picori Blade-Kokiri Blade in search of the Master Sword which must be pulled. 

                In other words:

                TimeLine speaking we see Skyward Sword in which really is Deuteronomy/Exodus/Numbers - more than the Genesis Creation Story. However, this can easily be seen to form a clear visual of a Foundation in that very sense. 

                Then we Move into the Genesis Accounts of Babylon.(Majoras Mask)

                Which moves us along into Minish Cap. Where Vaati(Demon) steals a WishCap(*cough* little hat) and shape-shifts between 4(types), kidnaps women, and takes them to his palace, and acts nearly identical to Majora(Mask) aka Baal - It is here in Majoras mask the parallelism is made - where we learn the "Elegy of Emptiness".

            </section>

                Finally, into Four Swords. Where Vaati breaks free again where again we see the same Parallelism from exactly the same conversation.

                Where we read in the prologue of Four Swords.
            <section class="blog-content">
                "Long ago, in the kingdom of Hyrule, there appeared a Wind Sorcerer named Vaati. Vaati could bend the wind to his will and used this awful power to terrorize many villages of Hyrule."-Four Swords

                "To return true light to this land, you must seal the doors of Stone Tower where the Winds of Darkness blow through. But Stone Tower is an impenetrable stronghold." — Igos du Ikana (Majora's Mask)

                "In his assaults on the villages, Vaati would kidnap any beautiful girls who caught his fancy. Many knights from the castle and other brave men set out to subdue the sorcerer and rescue the girls, but each one fell in turn to Vaati's awesome power. Just as the people had begun to lose hope, a lone young boy traveling with little but a sword at his side appeared."-Four Swords

                "Hundreds of soldiers from my kingdom would not even be able to topple it. It is far too reckless for one to take on such a challenge." — Igos du Ikana (Majora's Mask)

                "The villagers asked the girls how a boy so young could have saved them all and defeated the sorcerer when no one else could. The young girls told a story of how with just a wave of his sword, the boy's body shattered into four pieces, each of which then formed a complete copy of the boy. These four young boys then worked together to defeat the sorcerer. The people did not believe the story, but they called it the Four Sword nonetheless. As rumors of the blade's power to divide a person into four entities spread, the people built a shrine to protect it." -Four Swords

            <section>

                 You Learned the Song "Elegy of Emptiness" which is required to scale up the Stone Tower. A total of Four(Four Sword) shells can exist at any given time, one for each of Link's forms. They all play a pivotal role, but the Deku Link shell is too light in most cases which seems to represent the Minish-Picori/Kokiri with the Deku being Kokiri and later known as Koroks.

                As we are back to the Temple of Time in Ocarina of Time.

                Hence the Happy Mask Shop introduction in Ocarina of Time. The Happy Mask Salesmen being central focus in Majoras Mask that Majora attempts to deceive Link in a perpetual loop in a time where Majora ruled uncontested. Hence, after Skyward Sword when the heavens came down to the Earth - "and there were giants in those Days".

                Link is tempted to take the Majora Mask for himself as Vaati did to become like Gods. Which is represented in Links "Fierce(Hostile/Destructive) Deity(God) Mask" which is exactly what the (Majora Mask) is - Majora-Baal is essentially attempting to corrupt the Hero of Time.

            <p> I decided to bring one TimeLine ForeFront to remove Time paradox from the equation - which is a tough aspect to follow for many ; as I am attempting to be as clear as possible while being enjoyablebly easy to read. To do this I always attempt to lay frameworks in which are easy to follow and in this case the Child TimeLine Split is presented here seperate.</p>

                            <p>Temple of Time Opened - Ganon Sealed in the Sacred Realm for 700 years by Link.</p>
                            <p>What is fascinating here is this is the "Genesis Flood Story" which would put it Before "Majoras Mask" which normally is in the Child TimeLine - but not in Link NatSoc Theory for it is Second in the Entire TimeLine being the Origin story of the Picori/Kokiri Blade which is a perpetual Time Cycle. In great detail In Majoras Mask.</p>
                            <p>The question here becomes Is Windwaker actually second in the TimeLine coming after Skyward Sword which would push Majoras Mask to third in the TimeLine?</p>
                            <p>The Answer is Yes and No.</p> 
                            <p>Paradoxes you hate to love them.</p>
                            <p>Biblically wise the answer is Yes(Not just because of the Flood neither), just as Skyward Sword by foundation surpasses past Majoras Mask story of Babylon on Biblical TimeLine, SkyWard Sword also serves the Aspect of Heaven Descending to Earth(Genesis) in focus : although while passing over Majoras Mask(Genesis) : SkyWard Sword narrative was the Biblical TimeLine of Exodus in extrodinary detail. Which is quite genius in many ways as a parallel.</p>
                            <p>Just as here In WindWaker also by foundation Goes back before Majoras Mask Babylon(Genesis) : using the WindWakers Flood(Genesis) : yet it does surpass Ocarina of Time - but where we run into important facts that the Link here is the story of Vaati who was the Windmage, Wind Sorcerer, and Immortal Demon aka the Original WindWaker.</p> 
                            <p>This can not be ignored as far as the TimeLine is concerned. Although, Ganondorf resurrects Vaati in the Child TimeLine in "4 Swords Adventure" which is not to be confused with "4 Swords" where "Tetra/Princess Zelda" in WindWaker means to combine form of 4 parts - where Vatti the WindWaker begins to Rule in "The Minish Cap" and is bounded by "Four Sword".</p>
                            <p>Take Note Minish Cap comes directly after Majoras Mask, as Four Swords follows Minish Cap.</p>
                            <p>These direct References to Vaati are blatant with the Name of this chapter being "The WindWaker".</p>

                            <p>Indirectly one can easily tie the Flood to the Moon of Majoras Mask. As we see in WindWaker it was not the Moon that caused the Flood but the "Heavens".</p>

                            <p>So Yes one can confidently Place WindWaker After Skyward Sword and Before Majoras Mask and see the great TimeLine come to Perfect Life.</p>
                            <p>However by Time Paradox just as with Majoras Mask - one must keep them exactly where they are.</p>
                            <p>For this Reason I chose to leave WindWaker here in the Adult TimeLine for the mere sake of it does come after Ocarina Of Time(by Explanation). But, Unlike, Majoras Mask where there was no Temple of Time. Here in WindWaker the Temple of Time was Opened during the Imprisioning War which took place before SkyWard Sword. The flood comes after SkyWard Sword.</p>

        A "Link to the Past" comes specifically first in the "Fallen TimeLine". A Crucifixion, A Christian Rebirth which spirals into the Ages/Seasons of (LoRule), which Leads into Links Awakening... bringing us to the "LEGEND OF ZELDA".</div>

        If link goes back in time and warns the Royal Family in the "Child TimeLine" by Nameing the (((Ganondorf))) , (((Ganandorf) is expelled from Hyrule as banished to the "Twilight".

        Meanwhile if "Link" is sent home there is no "Hero of Time" when Ganondorf returns. 
        This also may be one of the most inspirational TimeLines. 

        With No Rising Hero to save Hyrule, it all rest on Faith of becoming a Hero of Time, from one who is not blessed to be the Hero of Time, but must fill the shoes to be a Hero of Time.
        Go Gen-Z!

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">
        Time Travel</h3>
        This is the aspect that confuses so many. The paradox of Time itself. The Only reason there is an Adult TimeLine in the Zelda Series and for perfect reason does the Adult TimeLine make perfect sense, and Point.

        This is where Theory's really come to life. However, Time is very restrictive.

        Seeing as the Temple of Time in the Ocarina of Time is where the Split occurs suggest this is where the power was harnessed as evidence of Insurrection Time Travel first takes place. Which led to the "Fall of Link"(Fallen TimeLine).

        As stated the "Child TimeLine" was created from Princess Zelda sending "Link" back to his right time which led to the warning and death sentencing of Ganondorf. 

        As the "Adult TimeLine" is the result in link going back in time. 

        I know that sounds like alot to take in, but I assure you it is not as complicated as it sounds.&nbsp;


        <div>
        The "Fallen TimeLine" was an insurrection of someone else knowledgeable, willing, and set on stopping "Link" by "Rewriting History". Making sure Link Failed. But who?

        None other than Ganondorf, the sneaky, cunning, deceiving, mastermind. Who not only tricked "Link" once before to collect the spiritual stones for him and "Open the Door of Time".&nbsp;
        </div>


        <div>
        But who would deceive "Link" a second time by convincing Link to go back in Time in order to rescue the "Spirit Temple" Sage. When at the Spirit Temple this is the End of Ocarina of Time, the Final Boss Fight Never takes place for Link was successfully removed from "TIME". Ganondorf won creating the Fallen Hero TimeLine. Link was Defeated as LowRule took over Hyrule.

        Puts a whole new meaning to being Jewed, *cough 6 Gorillian cough*.

        Upon returning to the Future freeing the Spirit Sage Ganondorf Fails. By default the Adult TimeLine continues.

        After Zelda sends Link back to his Original Time warning the Royal Family. Child TimeLine continues.

        The Ultimate Deception just like the (((Holocaust))), created a Defeated Link, Slain, and Crucified. A TimeLine of Defeat. Is no wonder the Christian Symbolism exist in the Fallen TimeLine.
        <blockquote>
        Now disclaimer - many say Upon return to child link there should be another TimeLine, as returning to adult link should be another TimeLine. So 2 TimeLines are missing. This is indeed not true. If time travel was indeed possible and not just theory, a extremely tiny handful would change anything at all. For the Mass Population are irrelevant. Fixing ones marriage, or what have you has 0 effect in the overall.

        You would still be killed by Ganon with your new loved spouse or what have you, and nothing changes. Or Hylians successfully stop and put an End to Ganon in which congrats on your lovely spouse but no effect what so ever in the overall.
        As for duplication Zelda only appears in Child, Tetra is the Incarnation Descendant in Adult, as Hilda becomes the defeat Zelda remain with Links Awakening and Princess Hilda.
        Zelda did a great job covering all bases. Yet so many say it was "Unintentional"...
        Sure sure what ever you want to believe.</blockquote>
        See easy- not complicated at all just basic cause &amp; effect.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
