                                    <p>From the Basics, to the obscure details. Our adventure starts here.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>If you skimmed the Link NatSoc TimeLine you will notice it looks radically different than the Original/Official Timeline. If one looks closer you will begin to see it is the Very Exact Same TimeLine as the Original/Official Timeline.</p>
                                    <p>Breaking this Theory up for the way of Presentation in the the way that I have has been Challenging to say the least. The Timeline is Religion, as Religion is the Racial TimeLine - for this reason I have decided the best way to explain the TimeLine without duplicating "Link NatSoc Theory : Religiously Faithful", "Link NatSoc Theory : Shielded Items", "Link NatSoc Theory : Racials", and "Link NatSoc Theory : TriForce" is by only referencing where absolutely necessary for understanding.</p>
                                    <p>However, here we will Focus on the Entire Picture in chronological order here therefore we are forced to follow the Biblical Aspect and the Major Events.</p>

                                    <p>As I Focused on "Ocarina Of Time" in the <a href="https://www.NineNeins.com/B-Topic/GreyingError/LNST/Synopsis"> "Link NatSoc Theory : Synopsis"</a> due to the Ocarina being the Central piece of the Story/Time - as well as being the most known to the masses allowing room to Introduce everything in a FreeForm Fashion allowing me the Freedom to Jump Up and Down the TimeLine to Solidify my Presentation. This also granted a path to create a Wide Scope Introduction, Text Format, Creative Ideas, and a to the point breakdown.</p>

                                    <p>However, the TimeLine is much more important THAN EVER especially now that many are attempting to say the TimeLine is irrelevant (much like Our Own History), as the Zelda Dev Team Obviously "with Breath of the Wild" have proven that just is not the case.</p> 

                                    <p>Making the Story and TimeLine even more so IMPORTANT. The Team(Whether consciously as a Whole in which I doubt - or where it really matters which is absolutely most likely) was absolutely sure to make sure the TimeLine of the Story is indeed Crucial.</p>

                                    <p>Which if one reads this Theory "Breath of the Wild" will instantly begin to making Perfect Sense. Please, keep in mind those that push the narrative the TimeLine/Story is irrelevant are the same ones who will write off the "Mirror Shield" as a mistake. Really!</p><br></article></div></section>

                                        <p>You may look at this Theory as nonsense, stupid, pathetic, or a waste of time. However, that does not change anything presented here.</p> 
                                        <p>There are tons of other materials at disposal if I had interest in nonsense, stupid, pathetic, ridiculousness, and just wanted to waste time. Yet, I am no fan of nonsense, stupid, pathetic, or wasting time.</p>
                                        <p>This is what inspired me to sit down and actully bring this presentation to life.</p>
                                        <p>If one wishes or wanted to waste time they would cover Harry Potter, or StarWars, or Tolkien, Matrix and plenty of other stories, topics, writers, etc - the problem there is these are not stories of Christianity.</p> 
                                        <p>Sure you can point to references, symbolism, or parts, or lines, or even scenery, title, characters, ect. Yet, at the end of the day they are pulling at nothing trying to create a narrative that is not there.</p>
                                        <p>Who is behind it - and Why does it exist - will destroy 100% of all claims if you use these sources mentioned above. There is no Christianity in them, plenty of blasphemy but zilch of Christianity.

                                        <p>Every Story has an influence and no doubt Christianity is pulled from all the time - that does not make a work Christian - it does not make it True - it does not suddenly represent Christianity - and if that is what someone is trying to do - you are but wasteing your time. As I stated I am no fan of that concept.</p>
                                        <p>Every story has a central influence, narrative, message, and recreation. This is critical to understand and acknowledge. Nothing comes and/or is created out of nothing and from nowhere.</p>

                                        <p>Zelda is no different when it come to these facts, it is the greatest representation of Christianity ever done it is the Central narrative. This is not a waste of time to bring to light - but a disection of one of the greatest masterpiece works of absolute art.</p> 
                                        <p>With every step of the way through Links NatSoc Theory you will learn so much - you will walk through the Bible with every step, explore History at every turn, and play one of the Greatest Games and Hear the story that requires no console, purchase, or controller in vivid imaginative detail - to solve the greatest Puzzle that took a Lifetime to create.</p>
                                        <p>Thats not a sales pitch for I have nothing at all to gain from putting Link NatSoc Theory together. Do not mistake me and assuming I am advocating Zelda as a substitute for the Bible - it is not. Quite the contrary, Zelda is a representative story of the Bible.</p>
                                        <p>I only invite you to come on an adventure with me.</p>

                <p>In fact, thinking Links name was just a random name... when it was the first blatant clue one should have pondered on. Yes, it is all Linked, your second clue was Time, your final clue was Story. When all put side by side the symbolism becomes undeniable as everything becomes crystal clear that everything is meticulously connected. Whether that be purposeful, non intentional, or plagurized accident.</p>
                <p>Which is it? I leave that for you to decide. I will say however, considering how blatant it is, obviously shoved in your face, to the point that any plausible deniability is ruled out to to the sheer volume of intricate details - that one can nolonger cry coincidence. For every coincidence happens to be a coincidence of a coincidences coincidences repeated coincidence. Eventually one has to face the fact - it is intentional.</p>
                <p>The fact that Zelda is indeed meticulously Linked togther perfectly in a near plagurized accident becomes undeniable.</p>

                <p class="tc"><strong>Soon you will see the battlefield for the first time.<br> This is a war and just as every war has one thing in common<br> with every other war.<br> Death.</strong></p> 

                <p> However we wont be talking about the Split of the TimeLine first, instead we will be Starting Back at the Very Beginning in Majoras Mask... oops spoiler... I mean further back to the Interloper War... no, hmm not there, how about we start when the Earth Flooded... nope. We have to go even further back.</p>

                <p>So where? How about right here at the Imprisoning War, wait now thats to far back, better save the first for last and do the last first. Yes, better to do that so that way it will all make sense. The Fall of Man aka Skyward Sword is where we will start.</p>
