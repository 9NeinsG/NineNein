                                <p class="pt">From the basics to the obscure details. Our adventure starts here.
                                <br>After reading this, especially if you are a Zelda fan or a NatSoc, you will never see the franchise the same way.
                                <br> 
                                Whether you are new to Zelda, familiar with the Legend of Zelda, or a fan, this synopsis is written for you and with you in mind.
                                <br><br> 
                                To save time and a lot of reading and writing, which I could easily write an entire book on, as this entire six-part blog is evident of. I instead will start and focus primarily on "Ocarina of Time" for this synopsis, for two reasons.
                                <br><br> 
                                1. Due to familiarity on a mass scale.
                                <br><br> 
                                2. The fact Ocarina of Time is the absolute best place to start, due to the fact that Ocarina of Time holds many of the fundamental keys to understanding and provides the best and most exciting way to explain and learn history.
                                <br><br> 
                                Each chapter of the story of "The Legend of Zelda" is identical continuously in nearly every way overall, with much more in-depth evidence of what I am and will be talking about in this writing, which includes everything outside of "Ocarina of Time," as we will see.
                                <br>

                                <h4>"Zelda Ocarina of Time"</h4>
                                <p class="pt"> The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time’ was released in 1998 and is considered by many to be one of the greatest games and franchises of all time.
                                <br><br> 
                                The solution to the jewish problem is a very attractive and appealing concept that draws the attention of everybody on Earth who wants to achieve justice and freedom.
                                <br>Especially among White youths.
                                <br><br>Consider this writing the tip of the spear. In fighting the jew, one is battling evil itself. Get your Bible and history books open, and prepare to experience the TimeLine of the Real Legend of Zelda.

                            <hgroup>

                                Parallelism</h4></hgroup>
                                <p>
                                    One thing to keep in mind is how parallelism works.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Parallelism is the interpretation of scripture by means of scripture, is a corollary of the belief in the unity of scripture.
                                    <br><br>
                                    In Practice I can tell multiple Biblical stories at the same time, while telling a single story because the concepts are identical. Such as say the Genesis account of the Flood for example.<br><br> 
                                    The why the flood happened is clear and unmistakable but is also sparse in the Genesis Flood account, however we can see examples of the account elsewhere such as Exodus with Moses, or in Jeremiah and Ezekiel in great detail although it is not the flood account persay, it is however accurate.
                                    <br><br> 
                                    This method is also extremely helpful when it comes to game mechanics as will be shown. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    When you are aware of what is happening in front of you you will begin to ask yourself how did you not notice how blatant Zelda was with it. Once you see it in action the Zelda TimeLine will make perfect sense and just how beautifully it was created.</p>

                                <h4>Nothing from Something</h4> 
                                <h5>2 Min Read</h5></hgroup>
                                <p>
                                    You may look at this theory as nonsense, stupid, pathetic, or a waste of time. However, that does not change what is presented here. There are tons of materials to choose from if I want to waste time.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I would cover Harry Potter, Star Wars, Tolkien, Matrix, and plenty of other stories. The problem here is that those are not stories of Christianity. Many will point to references, symbolism, parts, lines, or even scenery, titles, characters, etc.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Yet, at the end of the day, they are pulling at nothing, trying to create a narrative that is not there.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Who is behind it—and why does it exist—will destroy 100% of all claims if you use the sources mentioned above. There is no Christianity in them—plenty of blasphemy, but zilch when it comes to Christianity.
                                    <br><br>
                                    This is what inspired me to sit down and actually bring this presentation to life. I have no interest in creating something from nothing.</p>
                            <hgroup>
                                <h2 class="bible-content tc">
                                The Narrative is always Crystal Clear.</h2></hgroup> 
                                <p>
                                    Every story has an influence, and no doubt Christianity is pulled from all the time. That does not make a work Christian; it does not make it true; it does not suddenly represent Christianity, and if that is what someone is trying to do, you are just wasting your time. As I stated, I am not a fan of that concept.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Every story has a central influence, a narrative, a message, and a recreation. This is critical to understand and acknowledge. Nothing comes and/or is created out of nothing and from nowhere.
                                    <br><br>
                                    An imaginative mind could weave LOTR (Lord of the Rings) into a Christian Story if they really wanted to, but it inst, many shared concepts, but is not Christianity. No matter how you attempt to explain it - it will never be Christianity for just one example.</p>
                            <hgroup>
                                <h2 class="bible-content tc">
                                Reasoning.</h2></hgroup>
                                <p>
                                    Zelda is no different when it comes to these facts; it is however the greatest representation of Christianity ever done; it is the central narrative, as we will see nearly word for word. This is not a waste of time to bring to light, but a dissection of one of the greatest masterpieces of absolute art.
                                    <br><br> 
                                    With every step of the way through Links NatSoc Theory, you will learn so much—as you walk through the Bible with every step, explore factual history at every turn, all while playing one of the greatest games, and hear the story that requires no console, purchase, or controller in vivid imaginative detail—to solve the greatest puzzle that took a lifetime to create.
                                    <br><br> 
                                    That's not a sales pitch, for I have nothing at all to gain from putting Link NatSoc Theory together. Do not mistake me and assume I am advocating Zelda as a substitute for the Bible; it is not. On the contrary, Zelda is a representative story of the Bible in damn near plagurized word-for-word form, yet in near perfect representation.
                                    <br><br> 
                                    Millions have played and loved the journey and not even a clue they were reading and living the Bible - they just didn't know it. 
                                    I only invite you to come on an adventure with me.</p>

            Which just so happens to be a "<strong>mirror</strong>" that we need to recover that represents the "<strong>spirit</strong>". Sound Familiar?<br>

                    In short, <span class="po">"Bongo" </span> was converted by the devil's drum beat in reference to the <strong>Mirror</strong> of <span class="pp">"Bongo"</span>—the pied piper if you prefer - a shabbos goy if you understand that reference. All this to simply say <span class="po">"Bongo" </span> drank from the <span class="pp">poisoned well</span>.

                    To do this we must look to the very same man Professor Shikashi whom told us about the Well and the Lens of Truth. Who tells us about another connecting factor.

                    Is this cherry picking verses?<br>

                    There are only three mentions of or references to spiders in the Bible. Granted, all three are very similar in context but very different. Job 8 and Isaiah 59 are more of a compound on the topic of seriousness. All though they offer more clarity and background on the issue at hand, the <span class="pb">Water Garment</span> Reference navigates you to the truth.
                    <br><br>

                    Why does this matter?<br><br> 
                    This is due to the fact this is the same way and manner to address Navi, with Navi being just a play of words for "navigation".<br> Interesting, yet where does this navigation lead you?

            This deception is all easy to see now that we have dove straight into the shadow and brought light to the subject with open eyes.<br><br>

            Before we tackle the climb of <span class="pr">Death Mountain</span> to meet the <span class="pr">Gorons</span> let us for all practical matters ask why is the <span class="pr">hammer</span> so <strong>important</strong>. Again, like with the Spider we can not simply say Hammer and Hammer. Boom connection.<br><br>

            Yet, there are 6 verses that referenced <strong>"the hammer"</strong>. As one stands out immediately in direct reflection of the <strong>Mirror</strong>.
            It is fair to say that it is quite obvious, the <span class="pr">Mirror Shield</span> was stolen by the same <span class="pp">Shadow</span> that consumed <span class="po">"Bongo"</span>.

            Which leads us to <strong> Death Mountain </strong> where those to whom the <span class="pr">Shield</span> belongs live.</p>

            <p class="tc">It is fair to say that - but that is not what has happened.</p>

            The <strong>"mirror"</strong>interesting enough is not reflecting who you are, it is in fact representing what they have become. Is it not fascinating how the "Fable" <strong>Well</strong> story has got us here holding a <strong>Mirror</strong>, facing off against a <strong>Twin</strong> who embodies both <span class="pr">Red</span> and <span class="pb">Blue</span>. It is beyond any reasonable doubt <span class="pb">self</span>-<span class="pr">evident</span> that <span class="pp">Bongo</span>-<span class="po">Bongo</span> is at the very center of it all with the same 3 features constant front and center.

            <span class="pr">"Mirror Shield"</span>, which is a direct reference to which we are going to return, for now we can put it down. Instead, however, we must examine these <span class="pr">Gorons</span> for who and what they represent, and instantly, one of the most notable characteristics of <span class="pr">Gorons</span> is their love for<strong>Dancing.</strong>

                What an incredible "<strong>Revelation</strong>". Speaking of Revelation, we need to bring in the most never-mentioned Character in the entire Franchise, <strong>Ingo</strong>.</p> 
                <p><strong>Ingo</strong>, means to "<strong>Reveal</strong>", so who is this <strong>Ingo</strong> and why does he have such a strong connection with <span class="pb">Sunken City / Zoras</span>? This instantly brings to surface many never talked questions about this character of the Zelda series. Such as the many occupations of <strong>Ingo</strong> include "Real Estate", "thievery" Hollywood", and "Ownership of a Stolen Ranch" for examples. 
                <br><br>

                If <strong>Ingo</strong> means to <strong>Reveal</strong>, and <strong>Ingo</strong> has every characteristic and feature of <strong>Gorman</strong>, being his family. With <strong>Gorman</strong> meaning a "shyster", "sexual deviant", "bastard", "outcast" identical to the portrayal of <strong>Ingo</strong>(<strong>Gorman</strong>) and his 2 brothers aka the <strong>Gorman Brothers</strong>. 
                <br><br>

                Things fall into place effortlessly.<br>
                Don't think we will overlook the <span class="pr">Gorons Vase"</span> which <strong>always</strong> leads us to <span class="pb"> Zoras</span> whether <span class="pb">Sunken City</span> aka <span class="pb">Atlantis</span> or the <span class="pb">Fish/Zora</span>.

If one ignores scripture, then the Zelda timeline will never make sense or be rejected due to pretending to be racially blind. <br> BTW (Breath of The Wild pun intended),  this is the "Great Sin" and is explained perfectly in "The Legend of Zelda" which brings us to...

            <p>Welcome to the <span class="pr">Fire Sanctuary</span> right now you may be thinking I am conjecturing again. I dont blame you thats why we are here at the <span class="pr">Fire Sanctuary</span>.
            <br><br>
            What are the odds? If there was no connection, no message, no references, just random out of nowhere stories how is it everything is PERFECTLY synced.<br><br>

            Which just so happens to be protected by 3 ... you guessed it <strong>Frogs</strong>. Which require being given water to open the <span class="pr">Fire Sanctuary</span> which is on <span class="pr">top of a Mountain</span> far from <strong>the rivers</strong>. Two of these can receive water from Links bottles.(This will become clear in a little bit). The last one is a Giant Frog.
            <br><br>

            Why is any of this important?
            <br><br>

            This brings us to that <span class="pg">Ancient</span> <span class="pb">Cistern</span> aka <span class="pr">Gorons Vase</span>. Where we meet <span class="pp">Demon Lord: Ghirahim</span> aka the <strong> Dragon</strong>.
            <br><br>

            Notice the <span class="pg">Emblem</span> on the <span class="pb">Cistern</span> which is needed for the final <strong>Giant Frog</strong> and <span class="pb">who is inside.</span> Sitting in <strong>Sacred Water</strong> aka <strong>Living Waters</strong>. Meanwhile, it must be filled with <strong>Sacred Water or Living Water</strong> to heal the <strong>Water Dragon Faron</strong>.

            Thou art like a <strong>young lion of the nations</strong> (WindWaker),<br>

            When we look at this all through the <span class="pp">Lens of Truth</span> and holding the <span class="pr">Mirror Shield</span>. We can now return back to the present of "Ocarina of Time" with full understanding of the Colorful Cistern.
            <br><br>

            However, before we do let me quickly explain the "Young Lion" in the last Bible verse. We will cover this later but that connection seems appropriate to put here as a great prequel when we get to the Timeline split - and also will put in perspective everything stated here is True. As it should be a perfect way to sum up the "Colorful Cistern".

                <p class="pt">Why does the "Zelda" franchise always seem to be so mysterious and never directly answer questions? The answer is simple... it comes down to the <span class="pp">ADL jewrudos</span> ; the same ones that forced Zelda to remove content, and constantly complain, even adding the TriForce to the hate-database.</p>

                The same <strong>broken cistern which holds no water</strong> - have we learned nothing from the <span class="pg">Ancient</span> <span class="pb">Cistern</span>, and instead just like the <span class="pr">Gorons</span> we have adopted the same <span class="pp">babylonian rhethoric</span> - that we have tossed into a volcano, sealed away, and destroyed to overcome such <span class="pp"> evil </span>? Time and Time again... with the same <span class="py"> Christ</span> -<span class="pp"> killers </span> always at the center.
                <br><br>

                Through out this adventure thus far, on numerous occasions the names <span class="pp">TwinRova</span> &amp; <span class="pp">Baalim</span> have reoccurred. We have reached the point in time it is critical to finally bring them to the forefront to understand this "History of Greed and Hatred".  
                <br><br>

                I am sure some are asking but what about the Zoras? You skipped over the Zoras!<br>
                Rest assured I have not as we are getting to the Zoras - to understand the Zoras is to understand where they come into play.<br><br>

                Keep in mind I am trying to keep everything followable. So "Ocarina of Time" is our baseline" as "Oracle of Seasons and Ages" is Historical context, with "Skyward Sword" as evidence, all together will create a partial but full TimeLine to follow. Although other Titles will be referenced or mentioned only when critical to understand in this section.<br><br>

                To avoid overwhelming the Race, Religion, Item, Triforce, and Timeline are Dedicated to those particulars.<br><br>   

                Lets begin with Leviathan - <strong>the Beast</strong>. We touched on back in "Skyward Sword" at the end of <strong>Colorful Cistern</strong> The Mirror of <strong>Leviath</strong> Which ended with a quote from "<strong>Jabun</strong>" from the "Windwaker".

                As we enter the <span class="pb">"Belly of Jabu-Jabu"</span> which is simply <abbr title="Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.

                As we are back in "Ocarina of Time" the other reference will directly tie us to <span class="pb">"Oracle of Ages"</span>, again, the very Link we used to reach this very point!<br><br>  
                What a Connection. In <span class="pr">Oracle of Seasons</span> Jabu-Jabu is a Baby to small to enter - however by <span class="pb">Oracle of Ages</span> we enter the Belly of Jabu-Jabu however, instead of meeting<span class="pp">Baalim</span> as we do in "Ocarina of Time". We instead meet a <span class="pp">TwinRova</span> jellyfish.<br><br>

                If that was not enough connection, if we add in to enter Jabu-Jabu in "Ocarina of Time" you will need One Fish. To enter Oracle of Ages Jabu-Jabu you will need to rid the "Zora Seas" of the filthy seawater.<br><br>

                <p>You are stretching I can hear the skeptic yelling right now. As possibly true until you realize the same thing is taking place as with the <span class="pg">Ancient</span> <span class="pb">Cistern</span> aka the <span class="pr">Gorons Vase</span> for "<span class="pb">Zora Fountain</span>" is where ALL water flows from. This is made explicitly clear time and time again.<br><br>
                <strong>"The <span class="pb">Zora's Fountain</span> is famous for being the home of <span class="pb">Lord Jabu-Jabu</span>, the guardian deity of the <span class="pb">Zora people</span>. Being the source of Hyrule's water.</strong><br><br>

                It is the very same Fountain in which we retrieved Sacred Water for Faron with the Ancient Cistern. Again a repeated narrative as shown in the Colorful Cistern.<br><br>

                But, how can that be so this is the land of Holodrom...<br>
                No its the land of Labrynna...<br>
                No and No... Holodrom and Labrynna are not separate just like Termina they are ALL Hyrule.<br><br>

                The only thing that separates Holodrum(seasons) from Labrynna(ages) is 400 years. 
                Din(seasons) and Nayru(ages) are the Goddesses of Hyrule.<br><br>

                Lord Jabu-Jabu is present in both whom is guardian of Zora Fountain.<br>
                The Zora Rivalry is on full display as the Gorons are generational.<br>
                Both are eras of Hyrule.

             -<span class="pp">Ganondorf </span>(Twilight Princess)

            "This <span class="pp">power is granted to me by my god</span>! <br>

            "<span class="pp">Midna</span>... Foolish <span class="pp">Twilight Princess</span><br> The curse on you cannot be broken... <br> It was placed on you by the <span class="pp">magic of my god</span>! <br> The power you held as leader of the <span class="pp">Twili</span> will never return! <br> Already he has descended and <span class="pp">been reborn in this world</span>... <br> As long <span class="pp">as my master, Ganon</span> survives, he will resurrect me without cease!"
            <br><br>

            "You speak of magic? Still your tongue for a moment, whelp, <br> and I will tell you of both magic and the oppression of ages... <br> <span class="pp">The people of our tribe...a tribe</span> that <strong>mastered the arts of magic</strong>... <br> were locked away in this world like insects in a cage.
            <br><br>  
            In the shadows we regressed, <br> so much so that we soon knew neither anger nor hatred... <br> nor even the faintest bloom of desire. And all of it was the fault <br> of a useless, do-nothing <span class="po">Royal Family</span> that had resigned itself <br> to this miserable half-existence! 
            <br><br>
            I had served and endured in that depraved household for far too long, <br> my impudent princess. And why, you ask? <br> Because <span class="pp">I believed I would be the next to rule our people</span>! <br> THAT is why! But would they acknowledge me as their king? <br> No! And as such, I was denied the magic powers befitting our ruler. <br> It was then, in the thrall of hatred and despair, <br> that I turned my eyes to the heavens <br>...and <span class="pp">found a god</span>"

                    Future proves past as the Past proves the Present. The Timeline once again shines in perfect harmony. But what does this have to do with <span class="pr">King Dodongo</span>, the <span class="pr">Gorons</span>, or the <span class="pb">Mermaid Key</span>?
                    <br><br>

                    Look into the <span class="pr">Mirror Shield</span>. We are nearly at the very bottom of this <strong>Broken Cistern</strong> of <span class="pp">Bellum/Baalim</span>, <span class="pb">Zoras</span>, <span class="pb">Ocean Kings</span>, <span class="pr">Gorons</span>, <span class="pr">Fire Kings</span>, <span class="pp">jewrudo</span>, and the <span class="pp">Twili</span>.
                    <br><br>

                    We have the same thing occuring <span class="pr">Mirror Image</span> of all those that adopted that same <span class="pg">Ancient</span> <span class="pb">Cistern</span>, with <span class="pp">one of them</span> being the creators of the cursed <span class="pg">Ancient</span><strong> Broken</strong> <span class="pb">Cistern</span> now the <span class="pr">Goron Vase</span>. 
                    <br><br>

                    We also have a Timeline split in <span class="pp">three</span> <span class="pb">seperate</span> <span class="pr">paths</span> that lays before us. One is <span class="pb">Flood</span>, one is <span class="pr">Fire</span>. and one is <span class="pp">Twili</span>! Thats how we got here.
                    <br><br>

                    The <span class="pr">Fire Kings</span> just like <span class="pp">Midna</span>(Midianitish Woman), <span class="pp">Zant</span>(Zur), and the <span class="pb">Ocean Kings</span> - are named and Titled "<span class="pr">King</span>" such as <span class="pr">Helmasaur King, Gemesaur King, Helmaroc King, and of course King Dodongo</span>. <br>For along time very little about the difference in all these faction tribes was unknown in that region other than they were "Roving Creatures"- summed up as just some "<span class="pr">Hothead.</span>". All being enemy "Nations"/Rivals of the <span class="pr">Gorons</span> whom are actully Racial Brothers.
                    <br><br>

                    Making it thus far I feel it is safe to say <span class="pr">Gorons</span> are generally<span class="prIslamic">Islamic by Faith but not all by race.</span>
                    <span class="pr">Darunia, Darmani III, Gor Coron, Darbus</span> create the <span class="pr">Goron</span> Hierarchy/Kings - whom were wereing with the other "King Dodongos" in the region whom are purely muslim - an entirely different race - represented as serpants, dragon beast, lizards, and other "roving creatures" - unlike the <span class="pr">Gorons</span>.
