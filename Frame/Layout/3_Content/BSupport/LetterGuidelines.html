                    <p>Prison is never easy and it is twice as hard for White Nationalists. All prisoners are separated from their families for long periods of time but our people  they are surrounded by violent and hostile  minorities and guards and some have been railroaded simply for their beliefs.  Letters to our people are very important they can help them pass the time and maintain a sense of connection to their people.  </p>
                    <p>The mail rules for federal prisons are consistent but state prisons, county and city jails can vary widely.  These are meant to be general guidelines.   There is no limit as to the number of pages that an inmate can receive in written correspondence. There can be no place in the mail or letter to conceal contraband, and nothing larger than 8 inches by 10 inches is permitted. There is a five page limit of additional materials to the incoming mail, such as non-explicit clippings from magazines or photocopied materials.  Most institutions will not allow images printed on a color printer or colored envelopes as drugs can be infused in them.</p>
                    <p>Photographs can also be sent and count towards the five page limit of additional materials. No form of nudity is allowed in incoming mail to inmates. Polaroids are not permitted.</p>
                    <p>Designated employees of the prison may open and read any incoming or outgoing mail of inmates.  Always assume the mail will be read and do not include anything that breaks the rules or the law.</p>
                    <p>Any depictions or illustrations describing any type of illegal activity or activity which violates norms of society such as illicit sex, bestiality or cruelty, cannot be received or sent by inmates.</p>
                    <p>No business can be conducted using the mail while in prison.</p>
                    <p>All incoming mail needs to have the inmate’s committed name, his or her identification number and the correct address of the institution. There can be no abbreviations of the name of the institution and there can be no salutations other than what is standard–Ms., Miss, Mrs. and Mr.–in either the address to the inmate or in the return address. No artwork or messages can be sent on the outside of the envelope.</p>
                    <p>In Florida state prisons and some other state institutions, inmates may receive through correspondence up to 20 postage stamps in the mail. If they cannot afford stamps or writing materials and if none are sent to them, they are entitled to one letter a month with a stamp from the institution. There is a limit of 25 outgoing letters per month. This limit may vary in county or other jails, or in other state prisons.</p><br></section></div>
