        <p>A prison commissary is a store within a correctional facility,
        from which inmates may purchase products such as
        hygiene items, snacks, writing instruments, etc.</p>
        <p>Helping keep an inmate's commissary loaded up is a great way to show
        that you care. It can help them purchase the stamps, newspapers, and other
        items that help them connect with and keep up with the outside world.</p>
