                            <p>The goal here is focused on merely the most inspirational, powerful, and best of all presentation productions.<br>
                            Much of the content in pro-White circles is uncompressed makeing buffering and downloading an issue not to mention even dedicated search features are an unorganized hit and miss.<br>
                            The goal with NineNeins videos is to remedy these factors to make a more mainline, superfast stream - for a more enjoyable and shareable experience.</p>

                        <h5>Podcast</h5></hgroup>
                            <p>Since podcast noramlly come with video but not always it felt only fitting to add them here.<br>As most are aware I am no fan at all of podcasters, talking heads, and other worthless paywall intellectuals in general.<br>This does not mean there are not good voices out there, doing amazing works with shows that are informative, entertaining, and all around a great joy.<br>This is sadly just the absolute minority in these tube spheres.</p><p>For example there are only 2 presented here - to be fair there are 4 others under consideration.<br> I just have not decided if they are NineNeins mission focused or incorporateable into the development as of now. I feel it safe to say a couple will be added in coming days.</p>

                            <p>This has been a challenge with all the different platforms from Shing(streams), Piped(uploads), Bitchute(channels), Odyessy(channels/streams), etc...<br>I do not want to invest time manageing different video accounts or constantly bouncing between for whatever reason. That being said there are Channels I do think deserve recognition and will be featured here no matter platform.</p>
