                            <p>I kept the animated short and to the point to avoid listing endless top contenders such as RobinHood and The Great Mouse Detective which would just end up listing my favorite Disneys in order. Or wander down the other road from RockaDoodle and Fievel Goes West. So to prevent this I just settled on the All Else 5 Favorites that not only I would sit down and watch - but would recommend to parents.</p>

                            <p>This is simpler to round up to 10. There is a particular theme that will always win out above the others. This theme naturally and easily carved out my top with the question if I could only keep 10 movies. These are those movies.</p>

                            <p>This only expands into series - where things change a little or shifts in opposition to movies - or at least many tend to think so at first glance. A series is more than a message, more than the general idea as a movie is, it is an explanation - a deep dive into those concepts - a demonstration per say : played out in real time(series). It is rare to find a great series.

                            <p>
                            This pop-culture question is normal curiosity and how many attempt to rationalize things ; as strange as that may sound to many...
                            although this is not as strange as it may sound. In fact this is extremely normal. Especially when considering my ideology and beliefs in which pop-culture serves as a reference to help categorize the unknown into familiar concepts for them.
                            <br><br>
                            Such as the assumption: albeit also topping contenders for this question would be <span class="text-muted">Passion of Christ, Gladiator, Boondock Saints, GreenStreet Hooligans, The Patriot, 300, Law Abiding Citizen, Gangs of New York, or even How to Rob a Bank</span>...
                            <br><br> 
                            Many others with a more conspirator mindset would go a slightly different route by assuming the <span class="text-muted">Matrix, Equilibrium, Lord of War, V for Vendetta,</span> and others have gone straight to something like <span class="text-muted">Exam, The Interview(Hugo Weaving one), Faceoff, American Psycho, Cube, or Saw.</span>
                            <br><br> 
                            All of which are in my collection -- all in which I absolutely do in fact admire -- and all for the reasons many would probably never think they would be. However, out of all the hollywood movies/entertainment - my list(s) always seems to catch everyone off guard.
                            <br><br> 
                            So with that said this is why I share them here - they are a big influence, massive personal inspirations, some of the greatest works in my eyes, and because I am surprisingly asked ALOT.
                            <br><br> 
                            Maybe you haven't seen them and this list presents a chance to watch them, maybe you have seen them and hopefully will have some nostalgic effect. Either way I hope you get something out of them as I decided instead of a top 10 which is nearly impossible due to category - I would create 3 types with top (animated-5, movie-10, and show-8).
